# Lighthouse: High-Level Design - Annex A (Revised)

## Feature Pack 1: Context-Attached History (CAH)

### Executive Summary

Context-Attached History (CAH) extends Lighthouse's event-sourced architecture to capture and permanently retain the complete decision context for every file modification. Unlike traditional version control that only tracks *what* changed, CAH records *why* changes were made, *how* the AI reasoned about them, and *what circumstances* led to each decision. This creates an invaluable forensic trail for debugging, learning, and understanding AI behavior - particularly in edge cases where AI agents produce unexpected results.

**Critical Innovation**: CAH enables AI agents themselves to understand the causal chain of their past actions, allowing them to recognize when they broke something while fixing something else, leading to more intelligent and context-aware repairs.

### Motivation

During field testing, we observed incidents where AI agents produced completely unexpected outputs - most memorably, replacing functional authentication code with haiku poetry. While these edge cases are rare, understanding why they occur is critical for:

1. **Debugging** - Identifying the exact conditions that led to incorrect behavior
2. **Prevention** - Recognizing patterns that precede failures
3. **Learning** - Improving prompt engineering and validation rules
4. **Compliance** - Providing complete audit trails for regulated environments
5. **Trust** - Building confidence by making AI decision-making transparent
6. **Agent Self-Awareness** - Enabling AI agents to understand the consequences of their past actions

Traditional debugging approaches fail here because they lack the conversational context, environmental conditions, and reasoning traces that led to the AI's decision. CAH solves this by retaining EVERYTHING.

### The Agent Self-Awareness Revolution

#### Understanding Causality

With CAH, when an agent is asked to fix a broken test or debug an issue, it can access the complete causal chain:

```yaml
Agent_Causal_Understanding:
  Current_Request: "Fix the failing authentication test"
  
  Agent_Analysis_With_CAH:
    1. Test_Failure_Detection:
       - test_user_login started failing at 2024-01-15 14:30:00
       
    2. Causal_Chain_Discovery:
       - Edit_47: "Optimized database queries" at 14:25:00
         ├── Changed: user_lookup() function
         ├── Reasoning: "Reduce N+1 queries"
         └── Side_effect: Removed eager loading of permissions
         
       - Edit_48: "Added caching layer" at 14:28:00
         ├── Changed: get_user_permissions()
         ├── Reasoning: "Improve performance"
         └── Side_effect: Cache not warmed for test environment
         
    3. Root_Cause_Identification:
       "I broke authentication while optimizing database queries.
        Specifically, I removed eager loading of permissions in Edit_47,
        then made it worse by adding caching without test env support in Edit_48."
        
    4. Informed_Repair_Strategy:
       "I need to restore permission eager loading OR warm the cache in tests.
        Let me check why I removed eager loading in the first place..."
```

#### Breaking the Mistake-Repetition Cycle

Without CAH, agents often repeat mistakes because they lack historical context:

```yaml
Without_CAH:
  Monday: Agent adds index, breaks unique constraint
  Tuesday: Agent removes index to fix error
  Wednesday: Agent adds index again (performance is slow)
  Thursday: Agent removes index again (constraint broken)
  [Infinite loop of ignorance]
  
With_CAH:
  Monday: Agent adds index, breaks unique constraint
  Tuesday: Agent removes index, BUT RECORDS WHY
  Wednesday: Agent asked to improve performance
    ├── Checks history: "I tried adding an index but it broke uniqueness"
    ├── Understands context: "The real issue is we need a composite index"
    └── Implements correctly: Adds composite index preserving uniqueness
```

### Enhanced Architecture for Agent Self-Awareness

#### Agent Memory Interface

```yaml
Agent_Memory_API:
  # When agent is asked to edit a file
  pre_edit_context_check:
    - GET /agent-memory/file/{file_path}/recent-edits
    - GET /agent-memory/file/{file_path}/my-edits
    - GET /agent-memory/related-failures
    
  # Agent receives context about its past actions
  historical_context_provided:
    recent_edits_by_me: [
      {
        edit_id: "edit_47",
        timestamp: "2 hours ago",
        change_summary: "Removed eager loading for performance",
        consequence: "authentication.py started failing tests",
        reasoning: "Thought permissions were loaded elsewhere"
      }
    ]
    
    related_breakage: [
      {
        broken_file: "tests/test_auth.py",
        broke_when: "edit_47",
        failure_type: "AttributeError: permissions not loaded",
        attempted_fixes: ["edit_51 (reverted)", "edit_52 (made it worse)"]
      }
    ]
    
    patterns_detected: [
      "You frequently break authentication when optimizing queries",
      "Previous successful fix: Always eager load security-critical data"
    ]
```

#### Conversation Context Injection

When an agent is asked to fix something, Lighthouse automatically injects relevant history:

```yaml
User_Request: "The login is broken, can you fix it?"

System_Context_Injection:
  "IMPORTANT CONTEXT: You recently edited authentication code:
   
   1. Edit_47 (2 hours ago): You optimized database queries
      - Removed eager loading of permissions
      - Tests started failing immediately after
      
   2. Edit_48 (1.5 hours ago): You added caching
      - Attempted to fix the performance issue differently
      - Made test failures worse (cache not initialized in test env)
      
   3. Edit_51 (1 hour ago): Your first fix attempt
      - Tried to restore eager loading
      - Reverted due to syntax error
      
   Review these changes and their consequences before proceeding."

Agent_Response_With_Context:
  "I can see the issue now. I broke authentication in my performance 
   optimization (Edit_47) by removing permission eager loading. My 
   subsequent caching attempt (Edit_48) compounded the problem.
   
   Let me fix this properly by:
   1. Restoring selective eager loading for security data
   2. Keeping the performance optimization for non-critical paths
   3. Ensuring cache warming in test environment
   
   This addresses both the breakage I caused and preserves the 
   performance improvements I was trying to achieve."
```

### The Learning Agent Pattern

#### Self-Improvement Through History

```yaml
Learning_Pattern:
  After_Each_Edit:
    - Record what was intended
    - Record what actually happened
    - Record whether it was reverted
    
  Before_Next_Edit:
    - Check if similar edit was attempted before
    - Learn from past failures
    - Suggest alternative approaches
    
  Example_Learning_Sequence:
    Attempt_1:
      intention: "Improve query performance"
      action: "Added covering index"
      result: "Deadlocks in production"
      lesson: "Need to consider lock ordering"
      
    Attempt_2:
      intention: "Improve query performance"
      recalls: "Last time caused deadlocks"
      action: "Added index with CONCURRENTLY option"
      result: "Success"
      lesson: "Use CONCURRENTLY for production index creation"
      
    Future_Attempts:
      agent_knowledge: "Always use CONCURRENTLY for production indexes"
```

#### Cross-Agent Learning

Agents can learn from OTHER agents' mistakes:

```yaml
Security_Expert_Broke_Something:
  edit: "Added strict CSP headers"
  result: "Broke inline scripts in admin panel"
  lesson_recorded: "Check for inline scripts before adding CSP"
  
Performance_Expert_Later:
  task: "Optimize admin panel loading"
  checks_history: Sees security expert's CSP issue
  learns: "Be careful about inline scripts in admin panel"
  action: "Externalizes scripts BEFORE adding optimizations"
```

### Enhanced Data Model for Agent Self-Awareness

```yaml
EditContext_Extended:
  # ... existing fields ...
  
  agent_self_awareness:
    related_past_edits: [
      {
        edit_id: string
        relationship: "broke_this" | "fixed_this" | "related_to"
        description: string
      }
    ]
    
    lessons_learned:
      what_worked: string
      what_failed: string
      why_it_failed: string
      better_approach: string
      
    causal_chain:
      triggered_by: edit_id | user_request
      caused_failures: [test_name | file_path]
      fixed_by: edit_id | null
      time_to_discovery: duration
      
    confidence_calibration:
      predicted_outcome: string
      actual_outcome: string
      prediction_accuracy: float
      confidence_adjustment: float
```

### Agent Memory Retrieval Patterns

#### Contextual Memory Queries

```sql
-- "What did I break recently?"
SELECT 
  e1.file_path,
  e1.edit_id,
  e1.timestamp,
  e2.file_path as broke_file,
  e2.failure_description
FROM edit_contexts e1
JOIN edit_failures e2 ON e1.edit_id = e2.caused_by_edit
WHERE e1.agent_id = 'builder_john'
  AND e1.timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY e1.timestamp DESC;

-- "Have I tried this before?"
SELECT 
  edit_id,
  timestamp,
  reasoning,
  outcome,
  was_reverted,
  revert_reason
FROM edit_contexts
WHERE agent_id = 'builder_john'
  AND similarity(current_task, task_description) > 0.8
ORDER BY similarity DESC;

-- "What patterns lead to my failures?"
SELECT 
  pattern,
  COUNT(*) as frequency,
  AVG(time_to_revert) as avg_discovery_time,
  array_agg(example_edit_id) as examples
FROM (
  SELECT 
    extract_pattern(reasoning) as pattern,
    edit_id as example_edit_id,
    time_to_revert
  FROM edit_contexts
  WHERE was_reverted = true
    AND agent_id = 'builder_john'
) patterns
GROUP BY pattern
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
```

### UI Enhancements for Agent Self-Awareness

#### Agent Memory Dashboard

```
🧠 Agent Memory View: builder_john
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Recent Consequences:
├── ✅ Fixed payment processing (2 hours ago)
│   └── Successfully resolved the Stripe integration issue
├── ⚠️ Broke authentication (3 hours ago)
│   ├── Cause: Removed eager loading in optimization
│   └── Status: Still broken, 2 failed fix attempts
└── ✅ Improved API performance (5 hours ago)
    └── 50% reduction in response time

Learned Patterns:
├── 🔴 Breaking Pattern: "Optimizing queries → Breaking auth" (3 times)
├── 🟢 Success Pattern: "Adding tests first → Successful refactor" (8 times)
└── 🟡 Caution Pattern: "Late night edits → Higher revert rate" (5 times)

Current Task Context:
"Fix authentication" - ⚠️ You broke this 3 hours ago in edit_47
Suggested approach: Review edit_47, understand what you removed
```

#### Conversation Enhancement

```yaml
# System automatically injects when relevant
User: "The login is broken"

System_Injected_Context:
  "[AGENT MEMORY: You modified login code 3 hours ago:
   - Removed permission eager loading
   - Added caching without test support
   - Two fix attempts failed
   View full context: /memory/edit_47]"

Agent: "I see I caused this issue. In edit_47, I removed eager 
       loading of permissions while optimizing queries. Let me 
       review why I made that change and fix it properly..."
```

### Conclusion

Context-Attached History transforms Lighthouse from a safety system into a self-aware, learning system. By giving agents access to their own history and the causal chains of their actions, we enable unprecedented levels of AI self-awareness and improvement.

When an agent says "Oh, I broke this when I fixed that other bug," it's not just debugging - it's demonstrating genuine understanding of cause and effect. This transforms AI agents from stateless tools into learning partners that improve with every interaction.

The ability for agents to understand their impact, learn from mistakes, and avoid repeating errors makes them dramatically more effective and trustworthy. Combined with cross-agent learning, this creates a collective intelligence that continuously improves, making each agent better than the sum of their individual capabilities.

With CAH, we don't just fix bugs - we understand why they happened, learn from them, and ensure they don't happen again. This is the difference between a tool and a true AI colleague.
