## Remediation Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Blockers (Weeks 1-3)
**Objective**: Resolve blocking issues preventing basic functionality

#### 1.1 Security Critical Fixes (Week 1)
**Owner**: Security Architect + System Architect

**FUSE Authentication Bypass Fix**
- **Issue**: Hard-coded "fuse_user" bypasses authentication in `complete_lighthouse_fuse.py:156`
- **Solution**: Implement proper agent authentication validation
- **Files**: `/src/lighthouse/bridge/fuse_mount/complete_lighthouse_fuse.py`
- **Effort**: 3 days
- **Acceptance**: All FUSE operations require valid agent authentication

```python
# BEFORE (CRITICAL VULNERABILITY)
if self.context.current_user == "fuse_user":  # Hard-coded bypass
    return True

# AFTER (SECURE IMPLEMENTATION)  
async def _validate_agent_access(self, path: str, operation: str) -> bool:
    """Validate agent has permission for operation"""
    agent_id = await self._get_authenticated_agent()
    if not agent_id:
        raise AuthenticationError("No authenticated agent")
    
    return await self.auth_manager.validate_access(agent_id, path, operation)
```

                                 check_same_thread=False,
                                 isolation_level=None)  # WAL mode
        self.db.execute("PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL")
        self.db.execute("PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL") 
        self._create_tables()
    
    async def append_event(self, event: Event) -> None:
        """Persist event with ACID guarantees"""
        with self.db:  # Automatic transaction
            self.db.execute(
                "INSERT INTO events (id, type, data, timestamp) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
