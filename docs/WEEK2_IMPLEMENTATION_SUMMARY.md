## Usage Instructions

### Run Complete Week 2 Testing
```bash
# Full Week 2 orchestration
python scripts/week2_orchestrator.py

# Individual test suites
python scripts/chaos_engineering.py
python scripts/endurance_test.py --demo  # 1-hour demo mode
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_week2_integration.py
```

### Review Results
```bash
# View final report
cat /home/john/lighthouse/data/week2_results/week2_final_report.json

# Check Go/No-Go decision
cat /home/john/lighthouse/data/week2_results/go_no_go_decision.json
```

## Production Readiness

The system is now equipped with:
1. ✅ Comprehensive security validation
2. ✅ Performance benchmarking tools
3. ✅ Chaos engineering framework
4. ✅ Integration test coverage
5. ✅ Automated decision framework
6. ✅ Detailed reporting system

## Next Steps

Based on the Go/No-Go decision:
- **If GO**: Proceed to Week 3 canary deployment (5%)
- **If NO-GO**: Execute remediation plan before retry

The implementation provides all tools necessary for thorough Week 2 validation as specified in the enhanced runsheets, ensuring production readiness before canary deployment.
