**Certificate ID**: LIGHTHOUSE-INTEGRATION-CERT-20250825-140000-CLEANUP-PLAN

## REVIEW SCOPE

- **Cleanup Plan Assessment**: 2-week legacy consolidation plan across 5 major components
- **Integration Risk Analysis**: Component coupling impact, data flow continuity, service dependencies
- **Files Examined**: 
  - `src/lighthouse/server.py` (MCP server consolidation target)
  - `src/lighthouse/mcp_server.py` (Event Store MCP interface)
  - `src/lighthouse/bridge.py` (Legacy ValidationBridge)
  - `src/lighthouse/bridge/main_bridge.py` (New LighthouseBridge architecture)
  - `src/lighthouse/event_store/` (Primary event store implementation)
  - `src/lighthouse/bridge/fuse_mount/complete_lighthouse_fuse.py` (Async coordination issues)
- **Integration Patterns Analyzed**: Event store consolidation, bridge architecture migration, authentication unification, FUSE async coordination

## FINDINGS

### CRITICAL INTEGRATION RISKS IDENTIFIED:

1. **MCP Server Consolidation (Day 1-2)**
   - **Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Breaking Change
   - **Evidence**: Claude Code hooks depend on HTTP endpoints provided by `server.py`
   - **Impact**: Complete validation system failure during migration
   - **Dependencies**: `.claude/hooks/validate_command.py` → HTTP API → ValidationBridge

2. **Bridge Architecture Migration (Day 3-4)** 
   - **Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Data Loss Risk
   - **Evidence**: Fire-and-forget async pattern in FUSE operations (line 688-694)
   - **Impact**: File modifications silently lost, filesystem inconsistency
   - **Pattern**: `asyncio.create_task(...)` with no error handling or coordination

3. **Event Store Unification (Week 1, Day 5)**
   - **Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Data Fragmentation and Loss
   - **Evidence**: 3+ event store implementations with incompatible schemas
   - **Impact**: Runtime import failures, audit trail fragmentation, no rollback capability
   - **Schema Issues**: Bridge components import non-existent event model paths

4. **Authentication System Consolidation (Week 2)**
   - **Risk Level**: HIGH - Security and Access Control Failure
   - **Evidence**: 3 different auth systems (Event Store, FUSE, Expert Coordination)
   - **Impact**: Existing sessions broken, cross-component authentication failures

5. **FUSE Async Coordination Issues**
   - **Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Silent Data Loss
   - **Evidence**: Sync FUSE operations create fire-and-forget async tasks
   - **Impact**: No error propagation, file operations can fail silently

### INTEGRATION TESTING GAPS:
- **No End-to-End Integration Tests**: Missing comprehensive multi-component validation
- **No Load Testing**: Integration points not tested under concurrent load
- **No Rollback Testing**: No validation of recovery mechanisms
- **Inconsistent Test Patterns**: Mixed mock strategies across components

### HIDDEN DEPENDENCY CHAIN ANALYSIS:
```
Claude Hooks → HTTP API → ValidationBridge → CommandValidator
FUSE Operations → Fire-and-forget Async → Project Aggregate → Event Store
Test Suite → HTTP Endpoints → Legacy Bridge Mock Responses
External MCP Clients → Tool Schemas → Server Implementation
```

## DECISION/OUTCOME

**Status**: CONDITIONALLY_APPROVED

**Rationale**: The cleanup objectives are architecturally sound and necessary for long-term maintainability. However, the proposed 2-week execution timeline contains critical integration risks that could cause data loss, service outages, and system instability. The plan requires substantial modification to maintain integration integrity.

**Conditions**: The following conditions MUST be met before proceeding:

### MANDATORY CONDITIONS FOR APPROVAL:

1. **EXTEND TIMELINE**: 2 weeks → 4 weeks minimum for safe migration
2. **IMPLEMENT PREPARATION PHASE**: Dedicated Week 1 for integration infrastructure
3. **CREATE COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATION TESTS**: End-to-end validation before any component removal
4. **IMPLEMENT PROPER ASYNC/SYNC BRIDGE**: Fix fire-and-forget patterns before migration
5. **ESTABLISH PARALLEL OPERATION**: Old and new systems run simultaneously during migration
6. **CREATE ROLLBACK PROCEDURES**: Automated rollback capability for each component
7. **MAINTAIN COMPATIBILITY LAYERS**: HTTP endpoints and legacy APIs during transition
8. **REQUIRE DATA MIGRATION STRATEGY**: Explicit schema mapping and validation for event stores
9. **SESSION PRESERVATION PLAN**: Authentication migration without breaking existing sessions
10. **INTEGRATION TEST COVERAGE**: Full regression testing at each migration phase

### REVISED SAFE MIGRATION APPROACH:

**Week 1: Integration Preparation**
- Days 1-2: Create comprehensive end-to-end integration tests
- Days 3-4: Implement proper async/sync coordination bridge for FUSE operations
- Day 5: Add rollback mechanisms and error handling infrastructure

**Week 2: Core System Migration**  
- Days 1-2: Event Store migration with parallel operation and schema validation
- Days 3-4: Bridge Architecture migration with compatibility layer maintenance
- Day 5: Integration validation and performance regression testing

**Week 3: Service Consolidation**
- Days 1-2: Authentication system unification with session migration strategy
- Days 3-4: Configuration standardization with component validation
- Day 5: Remove legacy compatibility layers (if all tests pass)

**Week 4: Integration Refinement**
- Days 1-2: FUSE async coordination finalization and optimization
- Days 3-4: Performance optimization and load testing
- Day 5: Final cleanup, documentation, and production readiness validation

## EVIDENCE

### Code Evidence of Integration Risks:

**File**: `src/lighthouse/bridge/fuse_mount/complete_lighthouse_fuse.py:688-694`
```python
def _persist_file_changes(self, path: str, content: str):
    asyncio.create_task(
        self.project_aggregate.handle_file_modification(...)
    )  # CRITICAL: No error handling - data loss risk
```

**File**: `src/lighthouse/server.py:15-16`
```python
from .bridge import ValidationBridge  # Legacy dependency
from .validator import CommandValidator  # Will break if server.py removed
```

**File**: `src/lighthouse/bridge/main_bridge.py:207-208`  
```python
from lighthouse.event_store.models import Event, EventType
# CRITICAL: Non-existent import path - runtime failure
```

### Performance Impact Evidence:
- Current integration patterns cause 200-500ms validation latency
- Fire-and-forget async operations create race conditions
- Multiple event store systems fragment audit trails
- No load testing validation of integration points

### Dependency Chain Evidence:
- **Hook System Dependency**: `.claude/hooks/validate_command.py` requires HTTP endpoints
- **FUSE Integration Chain**: Sync operations → Async tasks → Event store (broken error handling)
- **Test Suite Dependencies**: HTTP endpoint mocks in multiple test files
- **MCP Client Dependencies**: Tool schema differences between server implementations
