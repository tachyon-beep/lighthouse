## TESTS PERFORMED
- Component interface analysis and dependency mapping
- Event flow tracing through all integration points
- Async/sync coordination pattern assessment
- External system integration validation
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Race condition and concurrency issue analysis
- Configuration management integration review

## FINDINGS

### Architecture Quality Assessment
- **Overall Implementation**: ~80% complete with sophisticated component design
- **Integration Maturity**: Significant gaps prevent coordinated operation
- **Code Quality**: High-quality individual components with good error handling
- **Performance Optimization**: Excellent speed layer design with circuit breakers and caching

### Critical Integration Issues Identified

#### 1. Event Store Integration Gap (HIGH SEVERITY)
- **Location**: Throughout bridge components  
- **Issue**: Bridge imports `lighthouse.event_store.models` but Phase 1 Event Store located elsewhere
- **Impact**: Event persistence may fail, breaking audit trails and time travel debugging
- **Evidence**: Import mismatches in project_aggregate.py:25 and custom event models in bridge/event_store/

#### 2. Async/Sync Coordination Crisis (HIGH SEVERITY) 
- **Location**: FUSE filesystem operations (filesystem.py:688-694)
- **Issue**: Synchronous FUSE operations create async tasks without coordination
- **Impact**: File modifications can be lost, race conditions during concurrent access
- **Evidence**: Fire-and-forget `asyncio.create_task()` calls in FUSE write operations

#### 3. Expert Coordination Integration Missing (MEDIUM SEVERITY)
- **Location**: Expert coordination integration points
- **Issue**: Security framework complete but missing core functionality
- **Missing Components**: FUSE stream processing, context package delivery, expert escalation processing, learning loops

#### 4. AST Anchor Event Integration Gap (MEDIUM SEVERITY)
- **Location**: AST anchoring system integration
- **Issue**: AST anchors created and cached but not persisted as events
- **Impact**: Time travel debugging incomplete, shadow filesystem not integrated

### Integration Flows Assessment

#### ✅ WELL INTEGRATED
- Command Validation Flow: Claude Code → Speed Layer → Multi-tier caching → Expert escalation
- Event Stream Communication: Real-time WebSocket with named pipe FUSE integration
- Security Integration: HMAC authentication, permission-based access control

#### ⚠️ PARTIALLY INTEGRATED  
- File Operation Flow: FUSE → Project Aggregate → Events (race conditions present)
- Performance Monitoring: Good individual component monitoring, needs cross-component coordination

#### ❌ NOT INTEGRATED
- Expert Coordination Flow: Security complete, functionality missing
- AST Anchor Persistence: No event generation for anchor operations
- Time Travel Debugging: State rebuilding not connected to anchor management

### External System Integration

#### ✅ SOLID
- **MCP Integration**: Clean API interfaces, compatible with Claude Code hooks
- **Policy Engine**: Optimized OPA/Cedar integration with Bloom filters  
- **Claude Code Hooks**: Proper validation request processing

#### ❌ BROKEN
- **Phase 1 Event Store**: Import path mismatches, event model inconsistencies

### Performance Integration Analysis
- **Speed Layer**: <100ms response time achieved through optimized caching
- **FUSE Operations**: Target <5ms compromised by async coordination issues
- **Event Processing**: Good throughput but needs consistency coordination
- **Expert Coordination**: Appropriate 30s timeout for LLM operations

## DECISION/OUTCOME
**Status**: REQUIRES_REMEDIATION

**Rationale**: The Lighthouse Bridge implementation demonstrates sophisticated architecture and excellent individual component design, but critical integration gaps prevent coordinated multi-agent operation. While the foundation is solid, immediate remediation is required for:

1. Event Store integration gaps that break audit trails
2. Async/sync coordination issues causing data loss risk  
3. Missing expert coordination functionality core to HLD requirements
4. AST anchor integration gaps preventing time travel debugging

The implementation shows high technical quality but integration issues prevent production deployment.

**Conditions**: The following critical issues must be resolved before the integration can be approved:

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix Event Store integration import paths and model consistency
2. **IMMEDIATE**: Resolve FUSE async coordination to prevent data loss
3. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Complete expert coordination FUSE stream integration
4. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Integrate AST anchor operations with event persistence

## EVIDENCE
- **File References**: 
  - main_bridge.py:263-276 (async coordination issues)
  - filesystem.py:688-694 (FUSE race conditions)  
  - project_aggregate.py:25 (event store import mismatch)
  - coordinator.py:150-300 (security complete, functionality missing)

- **Integration Test Results**: 
  - Component isolation tests pass
  - End-to-end integration flows fail due to coordination gaps
  - Performance tests show optimization potential constrained by race conditions

- **Architecture Assessment**:
  - HLD alignment: ~80% complete implementation  
  - Critical path blocking: Event store integration and async coordination
  - Performance targets: Achievable with coordination fixes
