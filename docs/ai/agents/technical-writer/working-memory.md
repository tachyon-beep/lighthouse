# Technical Writer Working Memory

## Current Task: Lighthouse MCP User Manual Enhancement
**Date**: 2025-08-26
**Status**: Comprehensive documentation enhancement in progress
**Priority**: HIGH - Production documentation requirements

### Documentation Enhancement Scope
- **Source Materials**: 
  - HLD document (`/home/john/lighthouse/docs/architecture/HLD.md`) - 1397 lines of comprehensive architecture
  - Current manual (`/home/john/lighthouse/docs/LIGHTHOUSE_MCP_USER_MANUAL.md`) - 625 lines focused on MCP messaging
- **Target**: Complete user manual covering all system capabilities
- **Focus**: Bridge architecture, multi-agent coordination, comprehensive workflows

### Key Enhancement Areas Identified

#### 1. Architecture Coverage Gaps
- **Current**: Limited to MCP messaging system only
- **HLD Shows**: Full bridge architecture with expert agents, shadow filesystem, event sourcing
- **Need**: Complete system architecture explanation

#### 2. Missing Workflow Documentation
- **Current**: Basic authentication and messaging
- **HLD Shows**: 
  - Speed Layer validation (policy â†’ expert escalation)
  - FUSE mount expert analysis
  - Pair programming coordination
  - Time travel debugging
- **Need**: Complete workflow examples for all patterns

#### 3. Missing Advanced Features
- **Current**: No coverage of advanced capabilities
- **HLD Shows**:
  - Event sourcing and querying
  - Shadow filesystem with AST anchoring
  - Multi-tier validation system
  - Expert specialization (security, performance, architecture)
- **Need**: Comprehensive feature documentation

#### 4. Integration Guidelines Missing
- **Current**: Basic MCP tool usage
- **HLD Shows**: Full deployment architecture, Docker compose, Kubernetes
- **Need**: Complete integration and deployment guide

### Documentation Structure Plan

#### New Manual Organization:
1. **System Overview & Architecture**
2. **Getting Started Guide** 
3. **Core Workflows**
   - Builder Agent Operations
   - Expert Agent Coordination
   - Multi-Agent Collaboration
4. **Advanced Features**
   - Event Sourcing & Time Travel
   - Shadow Filesystem
   - AST-Anchored Intelligence
5. **Expert Agent Specializations**
6. **Integration & Deployment**
7. **Troubleshooting & Best Practices**
8. **API Reference** (enhanced)

### Next Actions
1. Create comprehensive user manual with all HLD capabilities
2. Maintain existing authentication/MCP tool documentation
3. Add complete workflow examples
4. Include deployment and integration guides
5. Generate technical writer certificate for documentation review

### Notes
- Existing manual has solid authentication documentation - preserve and enhance
- HLD shows sophisticated architecture that needs proper documentation
- Focus on practical usage patterns while maintaining technical depth
- Include real-world examples and troubleshooting scenarios
