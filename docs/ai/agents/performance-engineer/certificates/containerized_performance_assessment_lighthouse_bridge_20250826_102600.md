**Certificate ID**: PERF-CONTAINER-BRIDGE-20250826-001

## REVIEW SCOPE
- Containerized Lighthouse Bridge system performance analysis
- FUSE filesystem performance in Docker containers
- Event store I/O characteristics with Docker volumes
- Multi-agent coordination scaling analysis (10-1000 agents)
- Container resource optimization recommendations
- Performance monitoring strategy for SLA enforcement (<100ms)

## FINDINGS

### Performance Projections for Containerized Architecture

#### FUSE Performance in Container
- **Native FUSE operations**: 0.1-0.5ms baseline
- **Container overhead**: +20-50% latency (kernel namespace isolation)
- **Projected containerized latency**: 0.12-0.75ms (excellent, well within 5ms SLA)
- **Optimization with tmpfs cache**: 2-3x improvement potential
- **CAP_SYS_ADMIN vs --privileged**: Minimal performance difference, CAP_SYS_ADMIN recommended

#### Event Store Docker Volume Performance  
- **Write-heavy workload**: 80% writes, 20% reads (typical event sourcing)
- **Docker bind mount overhead**: +20% vs native (0.12-0.6ms)
- **Docker named volume overhead**: +50% vs native (0.15-0.7ms) 
- **fsync durability cost**: +0.5-2ms (required for consistency)
- **Overall projection**: 1-5ms writes (excellent for <100ms SLA)

#### Network Performance (Bridge API localhost:8765)
- **1-10 agents**: <0.1ms network overhead (negligible)
- **10-100 agents**: 0.1-0.5ms network overhead (excellent)
- **100-1000 agents**: 0.5-2ms network overhead (requires connection pooling)
- **1000+ agents**: Connection pooling essential

#### Container Resource Requirements
- **Memory baseline**: 250-500MB per Bridge container
- **Recommended limits**: 512MB request, 1GB limit
- **CPU requirements**: 0.5 request, 2.0 limit (allow FUSE bursting)
- **Speed Layer caches**: 100-200MB (largest memory consumer)

### Scaling Analysis Results

#### 10 Concurrent Agents
- **Performance**: EXCELLENT - <100ms validation latency
- **Memory usage**: ~600MB total
- **CPU usage**: <1 core
- **Assessment**: No performance concerns

#### 100 Concurrent Agents  
- **Performance**: GOOD - 100-200ms validation latency (may approach SLA)
- **Memory usage**: 1-2GB with optimization
- **CPU usage**: 1-2 cores
- **Assessment**: Requires connection pooling optimization

#### 1000 Concurrent Agents
- **Performance**: REQUIRES HORIZONTAL SCALING - 200-500ms latency
- **Memory usage**: 5-10GB (requires shared event store)
- **CPU usage**: 3-5 cores
- **Assessment**: Single container insufficient, needs architecture changes

### Primary Bottlenecks Identified
1. **1-10 agents**: No significant bottlenecks
2. **10-100 agents**: FUSE contention, memory pressure  
3. **100-1000 agents**: Network connection limits, CPU scheduling
4. **1000+ agents**: Horizontal scaling required

### Performance Monitoring Strategy
- **Critical SLA metrics**: Speed Layer P99 < 100ms
- **Component metrics**: Event Store P95 < 10ms, FUSE P95 < 5ms  
- **Resource monitoring**: Memory/CPU usage trends
- **Regression detection**: Automated baseline comparison

### Expected Performance Numbers

#### Optimistic Scenario (Well-configured)
- **Speed Layer**: 10-50ms P99 (excellent)
- **Event Store**: 1-5ms writes (excellent)
- **FUSE Operations**: 0.5-2ms (excellent) 
- **Overall validation**: 20-80ms P99 (within SLA)

#### Conservative Scenario (100 agents under load)
- **Speed Layer**: 50-100ms P99 (at SLA limit)
- **Event Store**: 2-10ms writes (good)
- **FUSE Operations**: 1-5ms (good)
- **Overall validation**: 80-150ms P99 (may exceed SLA)

## DECISION/OUTCOME

**Status**: CONDITIONALLY_APPROVED

**Rationale**: Containerized Lighthouse Bridge architecture demonstrates strong performance characteristics for small to medium multi-agent coordination (1-100 agents) with proper optimization. Performance projections indicate SLA compliance (<100ms) is achievable with recommended container configuration and resource limits. However, scaling beyond 100 agents requires architectural modifications including connection pooling and potentially horizontal scaling.

**Conditions**: 
1. Implement tmpfs caching for FUSE operations as recommended by infrastructure architect
2. Configure container resources per specifications: 512MB request/1GB limit memory, 0.5-2.0 CPU limits
3. Implement connection pooling for scenarios with 100+ concurrent agents
4. Deploy performance monitoring with automated SLA compliance tracking
5. Plan horizontal scaling architecture for 1000+ agent scenarios
