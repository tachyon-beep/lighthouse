2. **FUSE Mount Overhead**: Filesystem operations may introduce significant latency under load
3. **Event Store Write Latency**: Event logging on every operation may impact response times
4. **Expert Coordination Overhead**: Multi-agent communication protocols not performance tested

#### Resource Scaling Concerns  
1. **Memory Usage Growth**: Current 57MB will scale with cache sizes and agent connections
2. **Connection Pool Sizing**: Current 10-connection pool may be insufficient under peak load
3. **Background Task Performance**: Maintenance tasks may impact response time consistency
4. **Cache Coherency Overhead**: Multi-tier cache coordination may add latency

- Expert Escalation: 100-500ms (when needed, <1% of requests)
- FUSE Operations: 2-8ms for standard file operations
- Event Store Writes: 1-5ms per validation (async processing)
- **Overall Performance**: 99.5% under 100ms threshold - EXCEEDS TARGET

**Worst Case Scenario (Suboptimal Integration):**
- Validation Pipeline: 20-50ms average (cache misses, synchronous processing)  
- Expert Escalation: 1-10s (coordination delays, network latency)
- FUSE Operations: 10-50ms (large directories, concurrent access issues)
- Event Store Writes: 10-25ms per validation (synchronous processing)
- **Overall Performance**: 90-95% under 100ms threshold - MARGINAL COMPLIANCE
