- Load testing strategies and capacity planning
- Performance monitoring during rollout phases
- Success criteria and performance thresholds
- Resource utilization and scaling triggers

## FINDINGS

### CRITICAL PERFORMANCE GAPS IDENTIFIED

#### 1. Inadequate Performance Baseline Establishment (Week 1)
**Issue**: Only single-day baseline collection on Wednesday
**Risk**: Insufficient data for statistical confidence
**Impact**: HIGH - May miss performance regressions during rollout

**Missing Requirements**:
- Multi-day baseline collection (minimum 7 days)
- Peak/off-peak performance characterization
- Concurrent agent load profiling beyond 1000 agents
- Memory usage baselines for different agent workloads
- Network latency distribution analysis

#### 2. Insufficient Load Testing Strategy (Week 2)
**Issue**: Stress testing only reaches 1000 concurrent agents
**Risk**: System may fail at production scale
**Impact**: CRITICAL - Lighthouse multi-agent coordination requires higher concurrency

**Missing Requirements**:
- Load testing up to 10,000+ concurrent agents
- Sustained load testing (24+ hour endurance tests)
- Memory leak detection during extended operation
- Database connection pooling limits validation
- Event store performance under sustained write load

#### 3. Inadequate Performance Monitoring During Rollout
**Issue**: Generic monitoring without agent-specific metrics
**Risk**: Cannot identify coordination performance bottlenecks
**Impact**: HIGH - Multi-agent performance degradation may go undetected

**Missing Metrics**:
- Agent-to-agent coordination latency
- Expert validation response times
- Event sourcing write/read latencies
- Bridge coordination overhead per agent
- Memory usage per active agent session

#### 4. Unrealistic Performance Success Criteria
**Issue**: P99 latency target of 500ms is insufficient for responsive coordination
**Risk**: System may meet targets but feel sluggish to users
**Impact**: MEDIUM - User experience degradation

**Recommendations**:
- P50 latency: < 50ms (not specified)
- P95 latency: < 200ms (not specified)
- P99 latency: < 300ms (current 500ms too high)
- P99.9 latency: < 1000ms (missing entirely)

#### 5. Missing Capacity Planning Details
**Issue**: No specific resource scaling triggers or thresholds
**Risk**: System may become resource-constrained without warning
**Impact**: HIGH - Could cause cascade failures during peak usage

**Missing Elements**:
- CPU utilization scaling triggers
- Memory usage thresholds per agent
- Database connection pool scaling rules
- Event store disk I/O capacity planning
- Network bandwidth requirements per agent

#### 6. Insufficient Performance Regression Testing
**Issue**: A/B testing in Week 6 compares wrong metrics
**Risk**: May miss subtle performance degradations
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Performance regressions could accumulate

**Issues with A/B Test Design**:
- "Latency improvement > 100x" is unrealistic expectation
- No statistical significance testing methodology
- Missing multi-variate analysis of performance factors

## PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED

### Immediate Corrections Required

1. **Extended Baseline Collection (Week 1)**
```bash
# Replace single-day baseline with comprehensive collection
python benchmarks/baseline_collection.py --duration 168h --intervals 1h
python benchmarks/peak_analysis.py --weekdays --weekends
python benchmarks/concurrent_agent_scaling.py --max-agents 15000
```

2. **Enhanced Load Testing Strategy (Week 2)**
```bash
# Add sustained load testing
python benchmarks/endurance_test.py --duration 72h --agents 5000
python benchmarks/memory_leak_detection.py --duration 24h
python benchmarks/database_stress_test.py --concurrent-writes 10000
```

3. **Comprehensive Performance Monitoring Dashboard**
```python
PERFORMANCE_METRICS = {
    "coordination_latency_p50": "< 50ms",
    "coordination_latency_p95": "< 200ms", 
    "coordination_latency_p99": "< 300ms",
    "agent_registration_time": "< 100ms",
    "expert_validation_time": "< 150ms",
    "event_store_write_latency": "< 20ms",
    "event_store_read_latency": "< 10ms",
    "memory_per_agent": "< 50MB",
    "cpu_per_agent": "< 5%"
}
```

4. **Capacity Planning Formalization**
```yaml
scaling_triggers:
  cpu_utilization: 70%
  memory_utilization: 80%
  agent_registration_latency: 200ms
  event_store_queue_depth: 1000
  database_connection_utilization: 85%
```

### Performance Testing Additions

1. **Multi-Agent Coordination Benchmarks**
   - Agent-to-agent collaboration latency
   - Expert delegation performance
   - Consensus building efficiency
   - Cross-agent state synchronization speed

2. **Event Store Performance Profiling**
   - Write throughput under high concurrency
   - Read performance with large event histories
   - Query performance for complex agent coordination patterns

3. **Resource Utilization Profiling**
   - Memory usage patterns per agent type
   - CPU utilization during peak coordination
   - Network bandwidth consumption analysis
   - Disk I/O patterns for event persistence

### Rollback Performance Considerations

**Issue**: Rollback procedure lacks performance validation
**Addition Needed**: Post-rollback performance verification
```bash
# Add to rollback procedure
python benchmarks/rollback_performance_validation.py
python benchmarks/system_recovery_time.py
```

## DECISION/OUTCOME
**Status**: CONDITIONALLY_APPROVED
**Rationale**: The runsheets provide a solid operational framework but have significant performance engineering gaps that must be addressed before execution.

**Conditions for Full Approval**:
1. Extend Week 1 baseline collection to minimum 7 days
2. Increase load testing to 10,000+ concurrent agents
3. Add comprehensive performance monitoring metrics
4. Revise success criteria with more stringent latency targets
5. Add formal capacity planning with scaling triggers
6. Include memory leak and resource exhaustion testing
