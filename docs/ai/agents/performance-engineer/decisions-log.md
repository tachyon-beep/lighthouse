# Performance Engineer - Decisions Log

## Analysis: Remediation Plan Charlie Performance Assessment
**Date**: 2025-08-24
**Analysis Type**: Comprehensive performance review of remediation plan
**Document**: docs/architecture/REMEDIATION_PLAN_CHARLIE.md

### Decision Context
Reviewing Remediation Plan Charlie to assess whether the performance requirements, optimization approaches, testing framework, and timeline are realistic and sufficient for achieving the HLD performance targets.

### Key Performance Requirements Analysis
- Speed layer must maintain <100ms SLA for 99% of operations 
- Cache performance target: 95% hit ratio with sub-millisecond lookups
- Event store throughput requirement: 10,000+ events/second sustained
- FUSE operations: <5ms for common operations
- Multi-agent coordination: <100ms for coordination messages

### Performance-Critical Decisions Made
1. **Speed Layer Optimization Approach**: APPROVED - Plan includes proper cache hierarchy
2. **Performance Testing Framework**: REQUIRES ENHANCEMENT - Missing load testing specifications
3. **Resource Sizing Strategy**: CONDITIONALLY APPROVED - Needs capacity planning details
4. **Timeline for Performance Work**: REALISTIC but REQUIRES PRIORITIZATION
5. **Integration Performance Impact**: UNDER-ASSESSED - Needs more detailed analysis

### Benchmarking Evidence Reviewed
- Current system performance: 0.001ms validation average (WITHOUT HLD features)
- Existing components ready but not integrated
- Performance degradation risk when full features are integrated
- No current benchmarks for multi-agent coordination under load

## Previous Decisions Referenced

### Decision: Current Performance Analysis (2025-08-24)
**Context**: Completed comprehensive performance analysis of current Lighthouse system
**Finding**: System performs exceptionally well currently but this is WITHOUT complex HLD features
**Risk**: Performance will degrade significantly when full architecture is integrated
**Recommendation**: Prioritize integration performance testing in remediation plan
