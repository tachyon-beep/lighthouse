### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PERFORMANCE CONCERNS (Score: 4/10)

#### 1. **Integration Performance Gap - HIGH RISK**
**Issue**: Excellent individual component performance but **UNTESTED INTEGRATION**
- **Current Baselines**: Measured WITHOUT complex HLD features (LLM APIs, OPA policies, expert coordination)
- **Integration Risk**: High probability of significant performance degradation when components integrated
- **Missing**: Integration overhead analysis and mitigation strategies
- **Gap**: No realistic workload simulation (70% safe, 20% risky, 10% complex commands)

#### 2. **Load Testing Limitations - MEDIUM-HIGH RISK**  
**Evidence**: `test_distributed_cache.py` and performance test framework
- **Current Testing**: Sequential operations only, no concurrent multi-agent coordination
- **Missing**: 1000+ concurrent agent coordination testing under realistic load patterns
- **Gap**: No sustained 24-hour endurance testing under production-like conditions
- **Problem**: Redis connection failures in testing environment indicate infrastructure issues

#### 3. **Production Monitoring Gaps - MEDIUM RISK**
**Evidence**: Monitoring system exists (508-line metrics collector) but incomplete
- **Present**: Comprehensive metrics collection infrastructure with Prometheus export
- **Missing**: Operation-specific SLA enforcement and real-time alerting
- **Gap**: Cache hit ratio monitoring per tier, expert escalation performance tracking
- **Need**: Automated performance rollback procedures during regression

### üö® CRITICAL PERFORMANCE REGRESSION RISKS

#### **Integration Performance Impact Scenarios**

3. **Event Store Writes**: Write amplification during high validation rates (database bottleneck)
4. **FUSE Mount Overhead**: Filesystem operations may not scale to multi-agent usage patterns

#### **Concurrent Access Bottleneck Concerns**
1. **Cache Coherency**: Hit ratios may degrade significantly under concurrent multi-agent access
2. **Expert Coordination**: Response times completely unvalidated under load conditions
3. **Database Connections**: Connection pool limits will constrain performance under sustained load
4. **Resource Contention**: Multi-agent filesystem access patterns completely uncharacterized
