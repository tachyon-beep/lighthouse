# Security Architect Working Memory

## Current Security Assessment: Phase 1.1 Core Event Store

### High-Level Security Status: CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES IDENTIFIED

The Phase 1.1 Core Event Store implementation contains several critical security vulnerabilities that could compromise the multi-agent coordination system. Immediate remediation required before production deployment.

### Primary Security Concerns

1. **File System Security Weaknesses**
   - No directory traversal protection in file path handling
   - Insufficient file permission validation
   - No access control on event store directories

2. **Input Validation Gaps**
   - Missing size validation in critical paths
   - Inadequate sanitization of event data
   - Weak validation of file paths and names

3. **Cryptographic Implementation Issues**
   - Basic SHA-256 checksums provide integrity but no authentication
   - No encryption of sensitive event data at rest
   - Missing digital signatures for event authenticity

4. **Access Control Deficiencies**
   - No authentication or authorization mechanisms
   - Missing agent-based access controls
   - No audit trail for access attempts

5. **Resource Exhaustion Vulnerabilities**
   - Potential for disk space exhaustion attacks
   - Memory exhaustion through large batch operations
   - No rate limiting on event submissions

## Active Threat Modeling

### Attack Vectors Identified

1. **Malicious Agent Attacks**
   - Rogue agents could flood system with events
   - Corrupt event data to disrupt coordination
   - Exhaust storage resources

2. **Event Injection Attacks**
   - Malformed events could cause parsing failures
   - Large payloads could exhaust memory
   - Corrupted checksums could trigger infinite recovery loops

3. **Storage System Attacks**
   - Directory traversal to write outside event store
   - File system race conditions during rotation
   - Symlink attacks on log files

4. **Data Integrity Attacks**
   - Manipulation of event sequence numbers
   - Checksum collision attacks
   - Time-based replay attacks

## Next Security Actions

1. Implement comprehensive input validation
2. Add access control and authentication
3. Enhance cryptographic protections
4. Implement resource limiting
5. Add security monitoring and alerting
