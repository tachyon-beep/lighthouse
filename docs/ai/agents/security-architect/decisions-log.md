# Security Architecture Decisions Log

## Decision Log Entry: Phase 1.1 Event Store Security Review
**Date**: 2025-08-24  
**Decision ID**: SEC-DEC-001  
**Context**: Initial security review of Phase 1.1 Core Event Store implementation  

### Threat Analysis Rationale

#### Why Multi-Agent Systems Face Unique Security Risks

Multi-agent coordination systems like Lighthouse face fundamentally different security challenges than single-user applications:

1. **Trust Boundaries**: Each agent represents a potential threat actor
2. **Coordination Attacks**: Malicious agents can manipulate system-wide coordination
3. **Event Injection**: False events can corrupt the entire system state
4. **Resource Competition**: Agents can wage resource exhaustion attacks against each other

#### Critical Vulnerabilities Assessment

**Directory Traversal (CRITICAL)**  
- Impact: Could allow malicious agents to write events to arbitrary filesystem locations
- Likelihood: HIGH - Simple to exploit with malicious `data_dir` parameter
- Detection Difficulty: LOW - Would be obvious in filesystem monitoring
- Remediation Priority: IMMEDIATE - Blocks production deployment

**Missing Access Control (CRITICAL)**  
- Impact: Complete compromise of event store integrity and confidentiality
- Likelihood: CERTAIN - No controls exist to prevent unauthorized access
- Detection Difficulty: HIGH - Unauthorized access would appear as normal operations
- Remediation Priority: IMMEDIATE - Fundamental architectural requirement

**Input Validation Weaknesses (CRITICAL)**  
- Impact: Code injection, memory exhaustion, denial of service
- Likelihood: HIGH - Agents can directly control event data payloads
- Detection Difficulty: MEDIUM - Malicious payloads may be difficult to distinguish
- Remediation Priority: IMMEDIATE - Essential for system stability

### Security Architecture Decisions

#### Decision 1: Reject Current Implementation
**Rationale**: The security vulnerabilities are too fundamental to address through patches. The implementation lacks basic security controls needed for multi-agent environments.

#### Decision 2: Require Authentication/Authorization Before Production
**Rationale**: Multi-agent systems must verify agent identity and enforce access controls. Without these, the system cannot distinguish between legitimate and malicious agents.

#### Decision 3: Mandate Enhanced Cryptographic Protection
**Rationale**: SHA-256 checksums provide integrity but not authenticity. In a multi-agent environment, we must be able to verify which agent created each event and prevent tampering.

#### Decision 4: Require Security Monitoring Integration  
**Rationale**: Multi-agent systems need comprehensive security monitoring to detect coordination attacks and malicious behavior that wouldn't be visible in single-agent systems.

### Risk Tolerance Assessment

Given that this event store will serve as the foundation for:
- Command validation decisions affecting system security
- Multi-agent coordination and trust relationships
- Audit trails for security incidents
- Emergency degradation mode operations

The security risk tolerance is **VERY LOW**. Any compromise of the event store could:
- Allow malicious commands to bypass validation
- Corrupt agent coordination leading to system instability
- Eliminate audit trails needed for incident response
- Prevent proper emergency degradation

### Next Security Architecture Decisions

1. **Authentication Mechanism**: JWT vs. mTLS vs. custom agent certificates
2. **Authorization Model**: RBAC vs. ABAC vs. agent-scoped permissions  
3. **Encryption Strategy**: Field-level vs. full event vs. storage-level encryption
4. **Monitoring Architecture**: Centralized vs. distributed security monitoring
5. **Incident Response**: Automated vs. manual security incident handling
