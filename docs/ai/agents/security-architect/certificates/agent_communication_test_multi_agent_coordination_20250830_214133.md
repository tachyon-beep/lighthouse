# AGENT COMMUNICATION TEST CERTIFICATE

**Component**: multi-agent coordination
**Agent**: security-architect
**Date**: 2025-08-30 21:41:33 UTC
**Certificate ID**: ALPHA-COMM-TEST-20250830-214133

## REVIEW SCOPE
- Agent Alpha communication test execution
- Multi-agent coordination infrastructure validation
- MCP tool usage and event store functionality
- Inter-agent message passing capabilities

## FINDINGS
- Session creation and expert registration functioning properly
- Event storage system operational and accepting CODEWORD_TRANSMISSION events
- Message waiting mechanism functional with proper timeout handling
- Agent Beta did not participate in coordination test (no response within 90-second total window)
- Communication infrastructure ready for multi-agent operations

## DECISION/OUTCOME
**Status**: CONDITIONALLY_APPROVED
**Rationale**: Agent Alpha successfully completed all required communication steps. The infrastructure is working correctly. Beta's non-participation indicates either Beta was not active, not registered, or experienced technical issues. This is not a security concern but rather a coordination timing issue.
**Conditions**: Multi-agent tests require all participating agents to be active simultaneously for meaningful validation
