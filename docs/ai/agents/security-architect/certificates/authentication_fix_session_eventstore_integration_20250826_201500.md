# AUTHENTICATION FIX CERTIFICATE

**Component**: Session and EventStore Authentication Integration
**Agent**: security-architect
**Date**: 2025-08-26 20:15:00 UTC
**Certificate ID**: AUTH-FIX-20250826-201500

## REVIEW SCOPE
- Analyzed authentication failure: "Agent X is not authenticated"
- Examined session token validation flow across Bridge and EventStore
- Identified missing EventStore authentication during session creation
- Implemented automatic EventStore authentication in MCPSessionManager
- Tested authentication integration with debug analysis

## FINDINGS
- **Root Cause Identified**: Bridge session validation worked, but EventStore authentication was missing
- **Authentication Gap**: Session creation only registered with Bridge SessionSecurityValidator, not EventStore
- **Token Format Valid**: Session tokens were correctly formatted and signed
- **Integration Issue**: MCP functions require both Bridge session validation AND EventStore authentication
- **Security Impact**: Functions failed safely with authentication errors (no security breach)

## DECISION/OUTCOME
**Status**: APPROVED
**Rationale**: Critical authentication fix resolves user's session validation failures while maintaining security
**Conditions**: Implementation includes proper error handling and cleanup on session revocation

## EVIDENCE
- File: `/home/john/lighthouse/src/lighthouse/mcp_server.py` lines 88-102
- Added automatic EventStore authentication in `MCPSessionManager.create_session()`
- Added EventStore cleanup in `MCPSessionManager.end_session()` lines 137-141  
- Debug analysis confirmed authentication gap between Bridge and EventStore
- Test validation showed successful operation after fix

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT
- **No Security Vulnerabilities**: Fix maintains all existing security controls
- **Authentication Strengthened**: Now properly authenticates with both systems
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if EventStore authentication fails
- **Cleanup Added**: Proper deauthentication when sessions are revoked
- **Logging Enhanced**: Better visibility into authentication success/failure
