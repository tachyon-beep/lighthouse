**Recommendation**: Implement TLS or message-level encryption

#### ❌ Cache Poisoning Vulnerability (MEDIUM)
**Location**: Multiple cache implementations lack cryptographic integrity
**Issue**: Cache keys derived from user input without proper validation
**Impact**: Attackers could manipulate cache to return incorrect results
**Risk**: Validation bypass through cache manipulation
**Recommendation**: Add cryptographic signatures to cache entries

#### ❌ Time-Based Attack Vectors (MEDIUM)  
**Location**: Various timestamp-based operations
**Issue**: System clock manipulation could bypass time-based security controls
**Impact**: Authentication token replay, cache manipulation
**Risk**: Temporal security bypass
**Recommendation**: Use secure time sources and implement clock skew protection

## DECISION/OUTCOME

**Status**: CONDITIONALLY_APPROVED

**Rationale**: The Bridge implementation shows significant security improvements over previous assessments, with strong authentication, input validation, and memory security controls. However, critical vulnerabilities remain in FUSE authentication and expert communication that prevent full production approval.

**Conditions for Full Approval**:
1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Authentication and authorization system implementation
2. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Path traversal vulnerability fixes  
3. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Race condition elimination
4. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Memory security controls
5. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Input validation framework
6. ❌ **PENDING**: FUSE authentication integration (CRITICAL)
7. ❌ **PENDING**: Expert communication encryption (HIGH)
8. ❌ **PENDING**: Cache integrity protection (MEDIUM)

**Production Deployment Recommendation**: 
- **LIMITED DEPLOYMENT** approved with restricted FUSE access
- **FULL PRODUCTION** blocked pending resolution of FUSE authentication gap
- **PILOT TESTING** recommended with careful monitoring

**Risk Acceptance**: 
The current implementation provides substantial security improvements and can support limited deployment scenarios. Critical FUSE authentication gap must be resolved before unrestricted production use.
