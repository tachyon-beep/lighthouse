# Security Architect Next Actions

## Immediate Security Remediations (Week 1)

### Priority 1: Critical Vulnerability Fixes
1. **Path Traversal Protection**
   - Add path validation to `EventStore.__init__()`
   - Restrict `data_dir` to approved directories only
   - Implement canonical path resolution

2. **Input Validation Framework** 
   - Design comprehensive validation schema for event data
   - Implement size limits, type validation, content scanning
   - Add sanitization for string fields

3. **Access Control Foundation**
   - Design agent authentication mechanism (JWT recommended)
   - Implement basic authorization for read/write operations
   - Add agent identity verification to all operations

### Priority 2: Security Monitoring
1. **Security Event Logging**
   - Add security-focused structured logging
   - Log all authentication/authorization events
   - Monitor for suspicious patterns (rate limiting violations, etc.)

2. **Intrusion Detection**
   - Implement anomaly detection for event patterns
   - Monitor for coordinated attacks across multiple agents
   - Alert on potential security incidents

## Medium-Term Security Enhancements (Weeks 2-4)

### Cryptographic Enhancements
1. **Event Authentication**
   - Replace SHA-256 checksums with HMAC-SHA256
   - Implement shared key management for agent authentication
   - Add event signature verification

2. **At-Rest Encryption** 
   - Design encryption strategy for sensitive event data
   - Implement key rotation capabilities
   - Add encrypted storage for configuration secrets

### Advanced Access Controls
1. **Agent-Scoped Permissions**
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Design agent capability restrictions
   - Add event stream isolation between agents

2. **Resource Protection**
   - Implement per-agent resource quotas
   - Add rate limiting and burst protection
   - Design fair scheduling for multi-agent access

## Long-Term Security Architecture (Month 2+)

### Zero-Trust Architecture
1. **Comprehensive Agent Verification**
   - Implement continuous agent authentication
   - Add behavioral analysis for agent trustworthiness
   - Design agent revocation and recovery procedures

2. **Defense in Depth**
   - Add multiple layers of security controls
   - Implement security at network, application, and data layers
   - Design security fail-safes and circuit breakers

### Advanced Threat Protection
1. **AI-Powered Security**
   - Implement machine learning for anomaly detection
   - Add automated threat response capabilities
   - Design adaptive security controls

2. **Forensic Analysis**
   - Add comprehensive audit trail analysis
   - Implement security incident reconstruction
   - Design compliance reporting capabilities

## Collaboration Needs

### Immediate Support Required
- **system-architect**: Security architecture integration with overall system design
