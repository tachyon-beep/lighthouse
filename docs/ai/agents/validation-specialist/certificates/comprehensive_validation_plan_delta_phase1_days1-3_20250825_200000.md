## DECISION/OUTCOME

**Status**: CONDITIONALLY_APPROVED

**Rationale**: Phase 1 Days 1-3 implementation demonstrates substantial progress in resolving critical blocking issues identified in Plan Charlie while delivering significant value addition beyond basic objectives. The transition from complete test execution failure (0%) to 55.6% test pass rate with a comprehensive new test framework represents major improvement. Conditional approvals from specialists address manageable technical fixes rather than architectural blockers.

**Conditions for Full Phase 1 Continuation**:
1. **Event Model Enhancement**: Add `content_hash: Optional[str] = None` to Event class in event store models (1-hour fix)
2. **FUSE Test Isolation**: Fix context manager test mount point to use `/tmp/lighthouse_test_ctx` (1-hour fix)  
3. **Speed Layer Compatibility**: Verify and fix ValidationRequest serialization compatibility (2-hour fix)
4. **Test Pass Rate Validation**: Achieve 8+/9 tests passing before Day 4 Byzantine testing commencement

**Go/No-Go Decision for Days 4-7**: **GO - PROCEED WITH PHASE 1 CONTINUATION**

**Supporting Factors**:
- **Critical Foundation Established**: Import blocking resolved, comprehensive test framework operational
- **Specialist Consensus**: 3/4 specialists provide conditional approval with manageable conditions
- **Architecture Quality**: Complete HLD Bridge integration exceeds objectives and provides strong foundation
- **Risk Level**: LOW - All conditions are well-understood technical fixes with clear implementation paths
- **Timeline Alignment**: Phase 1 extended timeline (10 days) accommodates fixes plus comprehensive Byzantine testing
