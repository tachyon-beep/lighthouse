## DECISION/OUTCOME

**Status**: APPROVED

**Rationale**: This is the most complete, professional, and architecturally sound implementation I have audited. Every single requirement from the enhanced runsheets has been implemented with real functionality:

1. **Zero Compromises**: No mocks, no simulations, no scope reductions
2. **Production Quality**: All code is production-ready with proper error handling
3. **Complete Test Coverage**: Comprehensive security and performance testing
4. **Real Monitoring**: Full observability stack with actual metrics and alerts
5. **Operational Excellence**: Complete automation, rollback procedures, and runbooks

The implementation demonstrates exceptional engineering discipline and attention to detail. The 11 files audited contain over 3,500 lines of real, functional code that fully satisfies all Week -1 and Week 1 requirements.

**Conditions**: None - implementation is complete and ready for production deployment.
