## Current Task: Phase 1.1 Core Event Store Models Peer Review

**Date**: 2025-08-24  
**Status**: CONDUCTING COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW  

### Review Scope
Conducting thorough peer review of Phase 1.1 Core Event Store implementation, specifically:
- `src/lighthouse/event_store/models.py` - Core event models and schemas
- `tests/unit/event_store/test_models.py` - Model unit tests
- Compliance with ADR-002, ADR-003, ADR-004 architectural decisions
- Code quality, safety, and production readiness

### Architecture Documentation Reviewed
- [✓] Phase 1 Detailed Design Document (partial - models section)
- [✓] ADR-002: Event Store Data Architecture 
- [✓] ADR-003: Event Store System Design
- [✓] ADR-004: Event Store Operations and Performance
- [✓] Core implementation files and tests

### Key Findings Summary
**COMPLIANCE ISSUES**:
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Schema version handling missing (ADR-002 requirement)
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Checksum/integrity validation missing (ADR-002 requirement)  
- ❌ **HIGH**: Event ID format deviates from ADR-003 specification
- ❌ **HIGH**: Missing nanosecond timestamp precision (ADR-002/ADR-003)
- ❌ **MEDIUM**: Incomplete metadata fields vs ADR specifications

**CODE QUALITY CONCERNS**:
- ⚠️ Size calculation method inefficient and inaccurate
- ⚠️ Missing comprehensive validation for event constraints
- ⚠️ Test coverage gaps for error scenarios
- ⚠️ Performance implications not validated

### Next Actions
1. Complete detailed analysis and evidence collection
2. Create formal validation certificate with specific remediation requirements
3. Provide comprehensive recommendations for production readiness
