2. **Monitoring Integration**: Enterprise-grade configuration with real system endpoints
3. **Alert Infrastructure**: Complete operational framework with runbooks and escalation
4. **Configuration Validation**: All generated files pass format and operational checks

### Production Readiness Achieved
- **Monitoring Coverage**: Comprehensive metrics for performance, security, and system health
- **Alerting**: Multi-channel notifications with appropriate escalation policies
- **Operational Procedures**: Detailed runbooks for incident response
- **Integration Ready**: Real system endpoints configured (Prometheus, Grafana, PagerDuty, Slack)
- **Quality Assurance**: Validation Specialist has provided final APPROVAL

### Week 2 Progression Authorization
The monitoring infrastructure provides complete operational visibility needed for:
- **Performance Tracking**: P99 latency monitoring against <300ms target
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time violation detection and response

  retention: 30d
  
  metrics:
    elicitation_requests_total:
      type: counter
      help: "Total number of elicitation requests"
      labels: ["from_agent", "to_agent", "status"]
    
    p99_latency_milliseconds:
