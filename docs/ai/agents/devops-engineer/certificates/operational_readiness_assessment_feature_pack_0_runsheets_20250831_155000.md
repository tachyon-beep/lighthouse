## REVIEW SCOPE
- 12-week phased migration plan from wait_for_messages to MCP Elicitation protocol
- Deployment procedures across 5% â†’ 25% â†’ 50% â†’ 75% â†’ 100% rollout phases
- Rollback procedures and timing constraints
- Monitoring and alerting setup requirements
- Infrastructure scaling and capacity planning
- Team coordination and operational readiness checkpoints
- Files examined: /home/john/lighthouse/docs/architecture/FEATURE_PACK_0_RUNSHEETS.md (596 lines)

## FINDINGS

### âœ… STRENGTHS IDENTIFIED
1. **Sound phased rollout strategy** - Progressive 5%/25%/50%/75%/100% approach with feature flags
2. **Comprehensive weekly structure** - Detailed daily schedules with specific time allocations
3. **A/B testing framework** - Week 6 comparative analysis between elicitation and legacy systems
4. **Multiple monitoring dashboards planned** - Performance, security, migration progress, and system health
5. **Clear success metrics defined** - Error rates, latency targets, delivery rates, and security thresholds
6. **Thorough documentation approach** - Training materials, migration guides, and runbooks planned

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL DEFICIENCIES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE REMEDIATION
1. **Unrealistic rollback timing** - Claims <5 minute rollback impossible for distributed system; realistic target 15-20 minutes
2. **Missing infrastructure scaling calculations** - No capacity planning for 25%, 50%, 75% traffic loads
3. **Insufficient rollback procedure detail** - Missing graceful drain, data consistency checks, health validation phases
4. **No event store migration strategy** - Critical gap for data consistency during rollback scenarios
5. **Missing SLI/SLO definitions** - No formal service level objectives or measurement frameworks
6. **Inadequate auto-scaling configuration** - No horizontal/vertical pod autoscaler specifications

### ðŸŸ¡ MAJOR GAPS REQUIRING ATTENTION
1. **Pre-deployment health checks missing** - Need dependency validation and consistency checks
2. **No deployment automation pipeline** - Manual feature flag updates are error-prone
3. **Insufficient incident response framework** - Missing severity levels, response times, escalation matrix
4. **Database connection pool scaling unplanned** - Critical for event store performance at scale
5. **Cross-team coordination procedures missing** - No runbooks for downstream service coordination
6. **24/7 coverage and shift handoff procedures undefined**

### ðŸŸ¢ RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS
1. **Enhanced monitoring with business impact alerts** - Add agent communication failure and latency degradation alerts
2. **Comprehensive smoke tests post-deployment** - Integration, legacy compatibility, performance regression tests
3. **Load testing based capacity planning** - Establish scaling parameters through systematic testing
4. **Formal go/no-go criteria framework** - Technical, operational, and business readiness checkpoints
5. **Rollback readiness monitoring** - Real-time visibility into rollback capability and timing

## DECISION/OUTCOME
**Status**: REQUIRES_REMEDIATION
**Rationale**: While the runsheets demonstrate strong planning discipline and appropriate phased approach, critical operational deficiencies pose significant risks to migration success. The infrastructure scaling gaps, unrealistic rollback timelines, and missing automation could result in production incidents, extended outages, or failed migration requiring emergency rollback.

**Conditions**: The following items must be addressed before operational approval:

### HIGH PRIORITY (Complete before Week 1)
1. Revise rollback procedures with realistic 15-20 minute timeline including graceful drain phases
2. Complete infrastructure capacity planning with specific resource requirements per rollout phase
3. Define formal SLI/SLO framework with measurement windows and alert thresholds
4. Develop event store migration and rollback compatibility strategy
5. Create automated deployment pipeline to eliminate manual feature flag management

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Complete before Week 3)
1. Implement comprehensive pre-deployment health check suite
2. Establish auto-scaling configuration for all components
3. Create formal incident response framework with severity levels and escalation procedures
4. Design database connection pool scaling matrix
5. Develop 24/7 coverage plan with shift handoff procedures

### LOW PRIORITY (Complete before Week 6)
1. Enhance monitoring with business impact alerting
2. Create cross-team coordination runbooks
3. Develop comprehensive smoke test suites
4. Establish load testing based capacity validation process

## EVIDENCE
- File analysis: /home/john/lighthouse/docs/architecture/FEATURE_PACK_0_RUNSHEETS.md:1-596
- Rollback procedure analysis: Lines 452-488 show insufficient detail and unrealistic timing
- Infrastructure scaling review: Lines 227-241 lack capacity planning methodology
- Monitoring setup: Lines 514-540 missing SLI/SLO framework
- Go/No-Go criteria: Lines 490-511 too basic for production system migration

## RISK ASSESSMENT
- **HIGH RISK**: Infrastructure scaling without capacity planning could cause performance degradation
- **HIGH RISK**: Unrealistic rollback timing could extend outages during emergency scenarios  
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Missing automation increases human error probability during deployments
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Insufficient incident response procedures could delay problem resolution
- **LOW RISK**: Documentation gaps could impact team coordination but won't block migration

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION
1. Engage infrastructure team to complete load testing and capacity planning within 1 week
2. Revise rollback procedures with input from site reliability engineering team
3. Implement deployment automation before any production deployments begin
4. Establish formal SLI/SLO definitions aligned with business requirements
5. Create comprehensive incident response runbook with tested escalation procedures
