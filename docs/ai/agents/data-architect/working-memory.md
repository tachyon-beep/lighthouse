# Data Architect Working Memory

## Current Focus: Lighthouse Bridge Implementation Data Architecture Review

### Project Context
- **System**: Lighthouse MCP Server with validation bridge
- **Architecture**: Event-sourced multi-agent coordination system
- **Component**: Bridge implementation with speed layer, FUSE mount, expert coordination
- **Review Date**: 2025-01-24

### Recent Analysis: HLD Bridge Implementation Plan

#### Data Architecture Components Reviewed:
1. **Event Store Foundation**: Complete event-sourced architecture with proper aggregates
2. **Speed Layer Cache**: Multi-tier caching (memory/policy/pattern) for <100ms response
3. **Project State Management**: File system state reconstruction from events
4. **Data Models**: Comprehensive Pydantic schemas with MessagePack serialization
5. **FUSE Integration**: Virtual filesystem for expert agent interactions

#### Key Data Flows Identified:
- **Validation Pipeline**: Request â†’ Speed Layer â†’ Expert Escalation â†’ Decision
- **File Operations**: Command â†’ Aggregate â†’ Event â†’ State Update â†’ FUSE Sync
- **Agent Coordination**: Session Management â†’ Context Packages â†’ Expert Routing
- **Time Travel**: Event Replay â†’ State Reconstruction â†’ Historical Queries

### Critical Data Architecture Findings

#### âœ… Strengths:
- **Event-Sourced Excellence**: Complete immutable event logs with replay capability
- **Sophisticated Caching**: xxHash Bloom filters, lock-free hot paths, async-safe operations  
- **Rich Data Models**: Comprehensive event types, proper metadata, correlation tracking
- **State Management**: Complete file history, directory structure, agent session tracking
- **Performance Architecture**: Sub-millisecond memory lookups, optimized algorithms

#### ðŸš¨ Critical Risks:
- **No Persistent Storage**: Event store has no durable backend (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- **Missing Durability**: No WAL, transaction management, or crash recovery
- **Ephemeral Caches**: Redis integration referenced but not implemented
- **No Data Archival**: Unlimited event growth, no retention policies
- **Integration Gaps**: Phase 1 event store connection unclear

### Data Architecture Status: CONDITIONALLY_APPROVED

**Decision Rationale**: 
Exceptional data architecture design with sophisticated patterns, but critical implementation gaps in persistence and durability pose significant production risks.

**Required for Full Approval**:
1. Implement persistent event store backend (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
2. Add durability guarantees (WAL, transactions, crash recovery)
3. Complete cache persistence (Redis integration)
4. Implement data archival (event compaction, retention policies)
5. Add backup/recovery system with integrity verification

### Next Actions Needed:
1. **Immediate**: Implement SQLite backend for event persistence
2. **Critical**: Add transaction management and WAL for durability
3. **Important**: Complete Redis integration for cache persistence
4. **Planning**: Design event archival and retention strategies

### Data Patterns Observed:
- **CQRS Implementation**: Clear command/query separation in aggregates
- **Optimistic Concurrency**: Version-based conflict detection
- **Event Streaming**: Real-time event publication for live updates
- **Cache Coherence**: Multi-layer invalidation strategies

### Performance Targets:
- **Speed Layer**: <100ms for 99% of validation operations  
- **Memory Cache**: Sub-millisecond lookups with 95% hit rate
- **Event Store**: >10,000 events/second sustained throughput
- **FUSE Operations**: <5ms for common filesystem operations

### Technical Debt Items:
1. Missing persistent storage implementation
2. Incomplete cache backing store integration  
3. No distributed coordination for multi-node deployment
4. Missing data encryption at rest
5. Incomplete backup/disaster recovery procedures
