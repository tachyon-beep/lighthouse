- **Transaction Boundaries**: Clear command/event boundaries with rollback capabilities

### ⚠️ CRITICAL DATA ARCHITECTURE RISKS

#### 1. **CRITICAL: Missing Persistent Event Store Implementation**
**Risk Level**: HIGH
- Event store interface exists but no concrete persistence implementation
- In-memory event handling will lose all data on restart
- No durability guarantees for mission-critical operations
- Missing WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) for crash recovery

**Impact**: Complete data loss on system restart, zero durability guarantees

#### 2. **CRITICAL: No Database/Persistence Layer Integration**
**Risk Level**: HIGH  
- No SQLite, PostgreSQL, or other persistent storage backend
- Event serialization exists but no actual storage mechanism
- Missing database schema for event store tables
- No connection pooling or transaction management

**Impact**: System cannot persist any state permanently

#### 3. **CRITICAL: Incomplete Cache Persistence Strategy**
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH
- Memory caches are ephemeral, no persistence across restarts
- Missing Redis integration despite references in architecture
- Cache warming strategies not implemented
- No cache backup or recovery procedures

**Impact**: Complete cache invalidation on restart, degraded performance

#### 4. **CRITICAL: Missing Data Archival and Retention**
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- No event log compaction or archival strategies
- Unlimited event growth will exhaust disk space
- No retention policies or compliance data handling
- Missing snapshot management for large event stores

**Impact**: Unbounded storage growth, potential compliance violations

### 🔄 DATA FLOW AND CONSISTENCY ISSUES

#### 1. **Event Store Integration Gaps**
- Bridge references `lighthouse.event_store.models` but Phase 1 event store may not be fully integrated
- Potential version mismatches between bridge event models and core event store
- Missing event store client/server communication protocols
- No connection management for remote event store scenarios

#### 2. **Cache Coherence Concerns**
- Multiple cache layers without guaranteed consistency
- Missing cache invalidation coordination between nodes
- No distributed cache synchronization strategy
- Potential stale data in policy/pattern caches

#### 3. **Concurrency and Locking Strategy**
- Mixed async/sync patterns could create deadlocks
- Optimistic concurrency in aggregates but missing distributed coordination
- No distributed locking for multi-node scenarios
- Potential race conditions in cache batch operations

### 📊 PERFORMANCE AND SCALABILITY ASSESSMENT

#### Positive Aspects:
- **Speed Layer Design**: Well-architected multi-tier approach
- **Optimized Caching**: Sophisticated algorithms with performance monitoring
- **Async-First Design**: Proper use of asyncio throughout
- **Batch Processing**: Reduces lock contention and improves throughput

#### Concerns:
- **Memory Usage**: No bounds checking on event store memory usage
- **Cache Size Management**: LRU eviction but no proactive memory pressure handling
- **Connection Pooling**: Missing for database connections (when implemented)
- **Query Performance**: No indexing strategy for event queries

### 🛡️ DATA VALIDATION AND SCHEMA MANAGEMENT

#### Strong Points:
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Pydantic models with proper field validation
- **Business Rules Engine**: Well-structured rule validation in ProjectAggregate
- **File Content Validation**: Suspicious pattern detection and size limits
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing throughout the data models

#### Areas for Improvement:
- **Schema Evolution**: Strategy exists but migration procedures not detailed
- **Input Sanitization**: Need SQL injection and XSS protection for external inputs
- **Data Encryption**: No encryption at rest or in transit for sensitive data
- **Backup Validation**: No mechanisms to verify backup data integrity

### 🔧 INTEGRATION AND COMPATIBILITY

#### FUSE Integration:
- **Well Designed Interface**: Clean integration between FUSE and event store
- **Virtual Filesystem**: Proper abstraction for expert agent interactions
- **Missing Implementation**: FUSE mount manager references incomplete FUSE implementation

#### External System Integration:
- **Event Publishing**: Good foundation for external system integration
- **Missing Connectors**: No actual integrations with external databases or message queues
- **Authentication**: HMAC token system referenced but integration unclear
