**Certificate ID**: OPS-ARCH-EVT-2025012414300001  

## REVIEW SCOPE
- Performance requirements and validation criteria for Phase 1 Event-Sourced Foundation
- Error handling and failure mode design for production deployment  
- Development and testing infrastructure requirements
- Operational monitoring and observability architecture
- Integration with emergency degradation mode operational procedures
- Complete operational readiness for production deployment

## FINDINGS

### Performance Architecture
- **APPROVED**: Comprehensive latency targets (p50/p95/p99) with clear escalation thresholds
- **VALIDATED**: Throughput scaling targets based on realistic workload analysis
- **CONFIRMED**: Load testing scenarios cover all critical operational patterns
- **ESTABLISHED**: Performance regression detection with automated CI/CD integration

### Failure Mode Design
- **COMPREHENSIVE**: Three-tier failure classification (recoverable, human intervention, restart required)
- **ROBUST**: Data corruption detection with multiple validation layers and auto-repair
- **RESILIENT**: Network partition handling appropriate for single-node Phase 1 deployment
- **THOROUGH**: Storage failure scenarios with graceful degradation and recovery

### Development Infrastructure
- **PRODUCTION-READY**: Docker-based testing with realistic data generation at scale
- **AUTOMATED**: Complete CI/CD integration with performance validation gates
- **MAINTAINABLE**: Mock and stub strategies enabling testing without external dependencies
- **EFFICIENT**: Development environment setup optimized for rapid iteration

### Observability Architecture
- **STANDARDS-COMPLIANT**: Prometheus metrics with OpenTelemetry tracing integration
- **COMPREHENSIVE**: Structured JSON logging with complete context propagation
- **ACTIONABLE**: Health check endpoints with detailed component status
- **SCALABLE**: Alert integration with PagerDuty escalation and Slack team coordination

### Degradation Integration
- **SEAMLESS**: Event store health metrics directly trigger emergency degradation mode
- **RELIABLE**: Degraded operations maintain critical functionality with read-only fallback
- **CONSISTENT**: Recovery state synchronization with conflict resolution procedures
- **AUDITABLE**: Complete degradation event recording with priority handling

## DECISION/OUTCOME

**Status**: APPROVED  
**Rationale**: ADR-004 provides comprehensive operational architecture covering all critical aspects for production deployment. Performance targets are realistic and measurable. Failure handling is thorough with clear classification and recovery procedures. Development infrastructure supports rapid iteration with production-grade testing. Observability is complete with industry-standard tooling. Emergency degradation integration ensures system reliability.

**Conditions**: None - all operational requirements are fully specified and implementable.
