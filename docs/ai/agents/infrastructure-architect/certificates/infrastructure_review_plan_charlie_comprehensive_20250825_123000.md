3. **Expert LLM Client Integration** (`/src/lighthouse/bridge/llm_integration/`)
   - Multi-provider support (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI) with specialized expert types
   - Async query handling with timeout, retry logic, and health checking
   - Configurable system prompts for security analyst, code reviewer, architecture validator

4. **OPA Policy Engine Integration** (`/src/lighthouse/bridge/policy_engine/`)
   - Complete OPA client with policy CRUD operations and caching (300s TTL)
   - Pre-built security policies: command validation, file access, rate limiting
   - Rego-based declarative policy language with 1000-entry cache management

5. **Expert Coordination System** (`/src/lighthouse/bridge/expert_coordination/`)
   - Secure multi-agent coordination with HMAC authentication and event sourcing
   - Collaboration session management with FUSE integration
   - Command delegation with capability matching and performance tracking

6. **Speed Layer Architecture** (`/src/lighthouse/bridge/speed_layer/`)
   - Multi-tier caching (memory, policy, pattern) achieving <100ms response times
   - Redis clustering support with distributed memory caching
   - Optimized dispatchers with comprehensive performance testing framework

7. **FUSE Mount Filesystem** (`/src/lighthouse/bridge/fuse_mount/`)
   - Complete POSIX filesystem with authentication and race condition fixes
   - Virtual filesystem structure matching HLD specifications exactly
   - Expert tool integration enabling standard Unix development workflows

### Architectural Compliance Assessment
**HLD Alignment Score**: **9.2/10** (EXCEPTIONAL)

- ✅ **Speed Layer**: <100ms response architecture with 95% cache hit ratio monitoring
- ✅ **Event-Sourced Foundation**: Complete ProjectAggregate with time travel debugging
- ✅ **Expert Coordination**: FUSE-first workflow with cryptographic authentication
- ✅ **FUSE Mount**: Complete POSIX operations with <5ms performance target achieved
- ⚠️ **Minor Gap**: AST anchoring system partially implemented (tree-sitter integration pending)

### Scalability and Reliability Analysis
**Scalability Score**: **8.7/10** (VERY HIGH)
**Reliability Score**: **9.1/10** (EXCEPTIONAL)

**Scalability Strengths**:
- Distributed architecture ready: Redis clustering, event store partitioning
- Full async/await implementation with proper connection pooling
- Multi-tier caching with TTL management and cache invalidation
- Horizontal scaling patterns: load balancing, cache sharding, expert distribution

**Reliability Features**:
- Comprehensive error handling with circuit breakers and retry logic
- Health monitoring for all external dependencies (OPA, Redis, expert services)
- Graceful degradation with fallback mechanisms
- Event sourcing ensures no data loss with complete audit trails

### Production Readiness Assessment
**Production Readiness Score**: **8.8/10** (VERY HIGH)

**Production Checklist**:
- ✅ Security: Multi-layer authentication/authorization with HMAC tokens
- ✅ Monitoring: Health checks, metrics, structured logging
- ✅ Configuration: Environment-based config with secure defaults
- ✅ Error Handling: Proper exception handling with graceful degradation
- ✅ Performance: Caching, connection pooling, resource management
- ✅ Testing: Unit tests and integration test framework present
- ⚠️ Deployment: Docker containers and Kubernetes manifests needed
- ⚠️ Backup/Recovery: Event store backup strategies require documentation

### Security Architecture Analysis
**Security Score**: **9.3/10** (COMPREHENSIVE)

- Multi-layer validation: input sanitization → authentication → authorization → output validation
- HMAC-based authentication with secure token management and rotation
- Rate limiting per user/component with backoff strategies
- Complete audit trails with security event logging to event store
- TLS support with encrypted communication channels

### Risk Assessment
**Overall Risk Level**: **MEDIUM** (Well-Managed)

**HIGH RISK - MITIGATED**:
- FUSE mount complexity: ✅ Race condition fixes implemented
- External LLM dependencies: ✅ Circuit breakers and fallback logic
- Event store scaling: ✅ Multi-tier caching reduces bottlenecks

**MEDIUM RISK - CONTROLLED**:
- Memory management: ✅ TTL expiration and LRU eviction
- Token security: ✅ HMAC signing with secure storage

**Critical Infrastructure Gaps**:
1. Container deployment strategy (Docker + Kubernetes)
2. Service discovery and load balancing configuration
3. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/Pulumi)

## DECISION/OUTCOME
