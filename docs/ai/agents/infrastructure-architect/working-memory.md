# Infrastructure Architect Working Memory

**Project**: Lighthouse Bridge Implementation
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-24 12:00:00 UTC
**Current Focus**: Production Readiness Assessment

## Active Infrastructure Projects

### 1. Bridge Implementation Production Readiness Assessment
**Status**: CONDITIONALLY APPROVED
**Certificate**: `infrastructure_review_bridge_implementation_20250824_120000.md`

**Key Findings Summary**:
- Code quality is production-ready with solid architectural patterns
- Critical infrastructure gaps prevent immediate deployment
- Performance targets (<100ms speed layer, <5ms FUSE ops) need validation
- Missing external service automation and observability stack

**Blocking Issues for Production**:
1. No performance validation/load testing infrastructure 
2. Missing infrastructure-as-code for Redis, monitoring stack
3. FUSE mounting strategy undefined for containerized deployments
4. No comprehensive observability (metrics, logging, alerting)

**Priority Infrastructure Work**:
- P0: Performance testing suite with SLA validation
- P0: Infrastructure automation (Terraform/Docker/K8s)
- P0: FUSE containerization strategy
- P1: Observability stack implementation

## Infrastructure State Assessment

### Current Architecture Components Reviewed
- Speed Layer Dispatcher: 3-tier caching with circuit breakers
- FUSE Filesystem: Virtual filesystem with real-time updates
- Memory Cache: LRU with bloom filters and Redis backup
- Project Aggregate: Event-sourced business logic
- Mount Manager: FUSE lifecycle management

### Identified Infrastructure Dependencies
- **Required**: Redis Cluster (distributed caching)
- **Required**: Monitoring Stack (Prometheus/Grafana/AlertManager)
- **Required**: FUSE3 system libraries
- **Optional**: Load Balancer for horizontal scaling
- **Optional**: Log aggregation (ELK stack)

### Performance Requirements Analysis
- **Speed Layer**: <100ms for 99% of operations (UNVALIDATED)
- **FUSE Operations**: <5ms for common operations (UNVALIDATED) 
- **Memory Usage**: 2GB baseline + 100MB per session (ESTIMATED)
- **Throughput**: >10,000 events/second (UNVALIDATED)

## Current Infrastructure Gaps

### Critical (Blocking Production)
- No load testing framework to validate performance SLAs
- Missing infrastructure automation for external dependencies
- FUSE mounting undefined for container orchestration
- No production monitoring/alerting infrastructure

### High Priority
- No service discovery for multi-host deployments
- Missing security infrastructure (TLS, authentication)
- No backup/recovery strategy for stateful components
- Resource limits not enforced

### Medium Priority  
- Container images and orchestration configs missing
- No CI/CD pipeline for infrastructure changes
- Operational runbooks not defined

## Infrastructure Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (1-2 weeks)
1. **Performance Testing**: Implement K6/Locust tests for all performance targets
2. **Infrastructure as Code**: Create Terraform modules for Redis, monitoring
3. **Container Strategy**: Define privileged container approach or CSI driver for FUSE

### Short Term (3-4 weeks)
1. **Observability Stack**: Deploy Prometheus/Grafana with bridge-specific metrics
2. **Security Layer**: Implement mTLS between components
3. **Resource Management**: Add memory/CPU limits and quotas

### Medium Term (5-8 weeks)
1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Load balancer and service discovery
2. **Operational Excellence**: Monitoring runbooks and alerting rules
3. **Disaster Recovery**: Backup strategies for caches and event store

## Next Review Actions
- Schedule load testing implementation review
- Assess infrastructure automation completeness
- Review containerization strategy implementation
- Validate observability metrics implementation

## Decision History
- **2025-08-24**: Bridge implementation CONDITIONALLY APPROVED pending infrastructure work
- **Next Review**: Performance testing completion (planned 2-3 weeks)
