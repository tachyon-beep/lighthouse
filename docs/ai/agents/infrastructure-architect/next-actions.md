## Risk Mitigation

### Critical Risks
1. **FUSE Mount Containerization**: Complex privileged container requirements
   - **Mitigation**: CSI driver approach or proven privileged container patterns
   
2. **Database Migration Complexity**: SQLite to PostgreSQL migration risks
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing with rollback procedures
   
3. **Performance Degradation**: Infrastructure overhead impacting SLAs
   - **Mitigation**: Performance testing at each deployment stage

### Contingency Plans
- **Rollback Strategy**: Full infrastructure rollback procedures documented
- **Emergency Operations**: Manual override capabilities for all automation  
- **Alternative Approaches**: Backup solutions identified for each critical component

## Decision Points Requiring Review

1. **Service Mesh Selection**: Istio vs Linkerd vs Consul Connect
2. **CI/CD Platform**: ArgoCD vs Flux vs Jenkins X
3. **Secret Management**: Vault vs External Secrets Operator
4. **Database Clustering**: PostgreSQL HA vs CockroachDB for scale
5. **Container Runtime**: Docker vs containerd vs CRI-O
