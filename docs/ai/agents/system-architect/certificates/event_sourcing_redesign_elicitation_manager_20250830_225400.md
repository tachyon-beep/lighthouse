# EVENT SOURCING REDESIGN CERTIFICATE

**Component**: ElicitationManager (FEATURE_PACK_0)
**Agent**: system-architect
**Date**: 2025-08-30 22:54:00 UTC
**Certificate ID**: arch-es-redesign-20250830-225400

## REVIEW SCOPE
- Original design at: `/home/john/lighthouse/docs/architecture/FEATURE_PACK_0_ELICITATION.md`
- EventStore implementation: `/home/john/lighthouse/src/lighthouse/event_store/store.py`
- Expert Coordinator: `/home/john/lighthouse/src/lighthouse/bridge/expert_coordination/coordinator.py`
- Architectural violations identified by validation-specialist

## FINDINGS

### Critical Architectural Violations in Original Design

1. **Direct State Manipulation** (Lines 33-35, 67-68, 105-108)
   - Stores pending elicitations in memory dictionaries
   - Direct mutation of state without events
   - No audit trail for state changes

2. **Bypassed Event Sourcing** (Lines 60-62, 94-96)
   - Claims to use event store but only for logging
   - State not derived from events
   - Cannot replay or reconstruct state

3. **Mixed Concerns** (Lines 65-66, 98-103)
   - Manager directly handles notifications
   - State management coupled with side effects
   - No clear command/query separation

4. **No Replay Capability**
   - State stored in memory, not reconstructible
   - No snapshot support
   - Lost state on restart

5. **Inconsistent with EventStore Pattern**
   - EventStore uses pure append-only model
   - ElicitationManager uses mutable dictionaries
   - Breaks architectural consistency

### Architectural Corrections Applied

1. **Pure Event Sourcing**
   - All state changes through immutable events
   - State derived from event projection
   - Complete audit trail maintained

2. **Projection Pattern**
   - Current state is projection of events
   - Multiple projections possible
   - Clear separation of write and read models

3. **Snapshot Optimization**
   - Periodic snapshots for fast recovery
   - Incremental event processing
   - Configurable snapshot intervals

4. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Events handle state changes
   - Notifications as decoupled side effects
   - Authentication delegated to EventStore

5. **Consistency Guarantees**
   - Atomic event operations
   - Sequence-based ordering
   - Idempotent event processing

## DECISION/OUTCOME

**Status**: APPROVED
**Rationale**: The redesigned architecture fully embraces event sourcing principles, aligning with Lighthouse's core architectural patterns. All state mutations flow through the EventStore, providing perfect audit trails, replay capabilities, and consistency guarantees.

**Conditions**: 
1. Migration must preserve existing elicitation data
2. Performance testing required for projection rebuild times
3. Snapshot intervals must be tuned based on actual usage patterns

## EVIDENCE

### Original Anti-Patterns (FEATURE_PACK_0_ELICITATION.md)
- Lines 33-35: Direct dictionary storage
- Lines 67-68: State mutation without events
- Lines 105-108: Memory-based state management
- Lines 60-62: Fake event store usage

### Corrected Patterns (FEATURE_PACK_0_EVENT_SOURCED.md)
- EventSourcedElicitationManager class: Pure event-sourced implementation
- Lines 150-190: Event creation without state mutation
- Lines 290-340: State derived from event projection
- Lines 400-450: Snapshot support for optimization
- Lines 500-600: Background tasks for expiry via events

### Alignment with EventStore (store.py)
- Lines 119-189: Append operation pattern followed
- Lines 270-329: Query pattern matched
- Lines 423-431: Record creation pattern adopted
- Lines 534-570: Event parsing pattern reused
