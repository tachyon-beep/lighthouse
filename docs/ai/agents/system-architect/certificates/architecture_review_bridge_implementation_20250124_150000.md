#### **Production-Ready Patterns**
- **Circuit breakers** for resilience across all layers
- **Comprehensive error handling** with graceful degradation
- **Performance monitoring** with metrics collection and health checks
- **Resource management** with proper cleanup and memory management
- **Concurrency control** with optimistic locking and conflict detection

#### **Integration Excellence**
- **Phase 1 Event Store integration**: Seamless compatibility with existing event store
- **Backward compatibility**: Legacy ValidationBridge interface maintained
- **Component modularity**: Clean separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces
