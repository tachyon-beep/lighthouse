## REVIEW SCOPE
- Analyzed broken MCP server after MinimalLighthouseBridge removal
- Evaluated architectural options for fixing authentication and session management
- Assessed impact of false abstraction removal on system architecture
- Designed migration strategy from broken bridge dependency to direct component integration
- Evaluated risks and implementation timeline for architectural fix

## FINDINGS

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **MCP Server Completely Broken**: References non-existent `MinimalLighthouseBridge` class
2. **False Abstraction Correctly Removed**: MinimalLighthouseBridge was architecturally flawed with singleton anti-patterns
3. **Working Authentication Preserved**: CoordinatedAuthenticator pattern solving authentication isolation is intact
4. **Clear Architectural Path**: Direct EventStore integration eliminates need for bridge wrapper

### Architectural Analysis Results
- **Option A (Direct EventStore)**: Clear winner - eliminates false abstraction, preserves working patterns
- **Option B (New Lightweight)**: Unnecessary complexity and reinvention risk
- **Option C (Full Bridge)**: Massive overkill with performance and complexity penalties

### Technical Assessment
- **Authentication System**: CoordinatedAuthenticator working correctly, must be preserved
- **Session Management**: SessionSecurityValidator providing needed HMAC security
- **Event Storage**: EventStore provides all needed backend functionality
- **Abstraction Layer**: No bridge wrapper needed - MCP server can be direct EventStore client

## DECISION/OUTCOME
**Status**: RECOMMEND
**Rationale**: Option A (Direct EventStore Integration) is the optimal architectural solution that:
- Eliminates false abstraction without breaking working authentication patterns
- Provides clean, maintainable architecture with MCP server as EventStore client
- Minimizes risk through surgical changes to existing proven components
- Improves performance by removing unnecessary abstraction layers

**Conditions**: 
1. Must preserve CoordinatedAuthenticator integration exactly as implemented
2. Must maintain all existing authentication and session security patterns
3. Implementation must be surgical - replace bridge dependency only

## EVIDENCE
- **File Analysis**: `/home/john/lighthouse/src/lighthouse/mcp_server.py` lines 51, 66 - broken MinimalLighthouseBridge references
- **Authentication Success**: CoordinatedAuthenticator singleton pattern working in production
- **Component Dependencies**: SessionSecurityValidator, EventStore, SessionInfo all available independently  
- **Architecture Pattern**: EventStore designed as standalone component, no bridge wrapper required
- **Performance Impact**: Direct component usage eliminates abstraction layer overhead

## ARCHITECTURAL DECISION RATIONALE

### Why Option A (Direct EventStore Integration)
1. **Eliminates Root Cause**: Removes false abstraction that created architectural confusion
2. **Preserves Working Patterns**: CoordinatedAuthenticator authentication state sharing intact
3. **Clean Architecture**: MCP server as lightweight EventStore client is conceptually correct
4. **Low Risk**: Surgical changes to replace bridge dependency only
5. **Production Ready**: Uses proven EventStore and authentication components

### Why Not Option B (New Lightweight Components)
1. **Reinvention Risk**: Would recreate existing EventStore capabilities unnecessarily
2. **Authentication Complexity**: Would need to reimplement CoordinatedAuthenticator integration
3. **Higher Testing Burden**: New abstractions require extensive validation
4. **False Economy**: EventStore already provides needed lightweight interface

### Why Not Option C (Full Bridge Integration)  
1. **Massive Overkill**: MCP operations don't need FUSE mounts, AST parsing, or expert coordination
2. **Performance Penalty**: Full bridge has heavyweight components inappropriate for MCP use
3. **Configuration Complexity**: Would require mount points and project configuration for simple authentication
4. **Architectural Mismatch**: Full bridge designed for comprehensive project management, not MCP operations
