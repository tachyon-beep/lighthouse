# FUSE MIGRATION ARCHITECTURE DESIGN CERTIFICATE

**Component**: Bridge FUSE Mount Subsystem
**Agent**: system-architect  
**Date**: 2025-08-27 14:00:00 UTC
**Certificate ID**: ARCH-FUSE-MIG-20250827-001

## REVIEW SCOPE
- Analysis of current fusepy (libfuse2) implementation
- Assessment of migration requirements to pyfuse3 (libfuse3)
- Component impact analysis across Bridge architecture
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Files examined:
  - `/src/lighthouse/bridge/fuse_mount/complete_lighthouse_fuse.py` (1,175 lines)
  - `/src/lighthouse/bridge/fuse_mount/mount_manager.py` (551 lines)
  - `/src/lighthouse/bridge/main_bridge.py` (581 lines)
  - `/Dockerfile` (container configuration)
  - `/requirements.txt` (current dependencies)

## FINDINGS

### Architectural Observations
1. **Well-Contained Implementation**: FUSE subsystem properly isolated in `fuse_mount` module
2. **Clean Interfaces**: Proper abstraction from Event Store, AST Anchoring, and Project Aggregate
3. **API Mismatch**: fusepy uses synchronous operations while pyfuse3 is async-native
4. **Container Coupling**: Dockerfile hardcoded for libfuse2, requires dual-library support
5. **Performance Critical**: <5ms latency requirement for common operations

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Abstraction Layer**: FUSEBackend interface to support both implementations
2. **Adapter Pattern**: Bridge sync/async API differences
3. **Factory Pattern**: Runtime backend selection via configuration
4. **Phased Migration**: 7-week staged rollout with parallel testing
5. **Multiple Rollback Paths**: Environment variables, feature flags, container strategies

### Risk Assessment
- **Performance Impact**: LOW - Benchmarking will validate performance
- **Data Loss Risk**: NONE - Event-sourced architecture preserves state
- **System Stability**: MEDIUM - Mitigated by phased approach and rollback capability
- **Rollback Time**: <5 minutes via environment variable switch

## DECISION/OUTCOME
**Status**: APPROVED
**Rationale**: The migration plan provides a safe, systematic approach to modernizing the FUSE subsystem while maintaining system stability and performance. The abstraction layer pattern enables parallel implementation and testing, ensuring zero-downtime migration with multiple rollback options.
**Conditions**: 
1. Both backends must pass identical test suites before production migration
2. Performance benchmarks must show <10% degradation
3. Rollback procedures must be tested in staging
4. Monitoring must be in place before production rollout

## EVIDENCE
- Current Implementation Analysis:
  - `complete_lighthouse_fuse.py:29-43`: fusepy import and synchronous Operations class
  - `complete_lighthouse_fuse.py:246-392`: Core FUSE operations (getattr, readdir, read, write)
  - `mount_manager.py:22-27`: Current FUSE import dependencies
  
- Container Configuration:
  - `Dockerfile:10`: libfuse-dev installation (libfuse2)
  - `Dockerfile:29-31`: Runtime dependencies on libfuse2
  - `requirements.txt:5`: fusepy==3.0.1 dependency

- Architecture Alignment:
  - Bridge uses asyncio throughout (async/await pattern)
  - pyfuse3's async nature better matches existing architecture
  - Event Store operations already async-compatible

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions
1. Create feature branch for migration development
2. Setup test containers with both libfuse2 and libfuse3
3. Implement FUSEBackend abstraction layer
4. Create comprehensive benchmark suite

### Strategic Guidance
1. Consider maintaining dual-backend support permanently for flexibility
2. Use migration to enhance observability and monitoring
3. Document patterns for future subsystem migrations
4. Contribute improvements back to pyfuse3 community

### Implementation Priority
1. **Week 1**: Abstraction layer and configuration
2. **Weeks 2-3**: pyfuse3 backend implementation
3. **Week 4**: Testing and benchmarking
4. **Weeks 5-6**: Staged production rollout
5. **Week 7**: Cleanup and documentation

## DELIVERABLES
- Migration Plan Document: `/docs/ai/agents/system-architect/fuse_migration_plan.md`
- Updated Working Memory: `/docs/ai/agents/system-architect/working-memory.md`
- This Certificate: `/docs/ai/agents/system-architect/certificates/fuse_migration_architecture_design_20250827_140000.md`

## ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRITY
The proposed migration maintains Lighthouse's architectural principles:
- **Event-Driven**: All operations remain event-sourced
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Expert agents retain full filesystem access
- **Zero Disruption**: Migration can occur without service interruption
- **Performance First**: Benchmarking ensures performance requirements met
- **Safety by Design**: Multiple rollback mechanisms protect stability
