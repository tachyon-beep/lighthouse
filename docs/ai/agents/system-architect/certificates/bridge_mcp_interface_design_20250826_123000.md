# ARCHITECTURE DESIGN CERTIFICATE

**Component**: Bridge-MCP Interface Layer  
**Agent**: system-architect
**Date**: 2025-08-26 12:30:00 UTC
**Certificate ID**: bridge-mcp-interface-2025-08-26

## REVIEW SCOPE
- Analyzed current MCP server implementation (src/lighthouse/mcp_server.py)
- Reviewed Bridge architecture (src/lighthouse/bridge/main_bridge.py)
- Examined Expert Coordination system (src/lighthouse/bridge/expert_coordination/coordinator.py)
- Identified missing interface capabilities

## FINDINGS

### Current State
- MCP server correctly acts as thin adapter (627 lines)
- Bridge components properly imported and initialized
- Basic coordination tools exposed via MCP
- Missing critical expert registration and communication tools

### Gap Analysis
The following Bridge capabilities are NOT accessible via MCP:
1. **Expert Registration**: No way for Claude instances to register as experts with authentication
2. **Capability Discovery**: No tool to query available expert capabilities
3. **Secure Delegation**: Limited command delegation without full security context
4. **Communication Channels**: No access to FUSE-based real-time channels
5. **Context Packages**: No tools for creating/sharing context between experts

## DECISION/OUTCOME

**Status**: APPROVED
**Rationale**: The architecture is fundamentally sound. The MCP server correctly delegates to Bridge. Only need to add missing MCP tool wrappers.
**Conditions**: Must maintain thin adapter pattern, no duplicate implementations

## EVIDENCE
- Lines 19-22 mcp_server.py: Correct Bridge imports
- Lines 42-120 mcp_server.py: Proper Bridge initialization with fallback
- Lines 224-296 coordinator.py: Expert registration ready but not exposed
- Lines 407-485 coordinator.py: Collaboration features implemented but not accessible

## PROPOSED SOLUTION

### New MCP Tools to Add

```python
# 1. Expert Registration and Authentication
@mcp.tool()
async def lighthouse_register_expert(
    expert_role: str,  # security, performance, architecture, etc.
    capabilities: List[Dict[str, Any]],
    auth_credentials: Dict[str, str]
) -> str:
    """Register Claude instance as expert agent with specific capabilities"""
    
# 2. Expert Discovery
@mcp.tool()
async def lighthouse_discover_experts(
    capability_filter: Optional[List[str]] = None,
    status_filter: Optional[str] = None
) -> str:
    """Discover available expert agents and their capabilities"""
    
# 3. Secure Command Delegation with Context
@mcp.tool()
async def lighthouse_delegate_command_secure(
    target_experts: List[str],
    command_type: str,
    command_data: Dict[str, Any],
    required_capabilities: List[str],
    timeout: int = 30
) -> str:
    """Delegate command to specific experts with capability requirements"""
    
# 4. Real-time Communication Channel
@mcp.tool()
async def lighthouse_open_communication_channel(
    session_id: str,
    channel_type: str = "bidirectional"
) -> str:
    """Open real-time communication channel for collaboration session"""
    
# 5. Context Package Management
@mcp.tool()
async def lighthouse_create_context_package(
    package_name: str,
    files: List[str],
    annotations: Dict[str, Any],
    share_with: List[str]
) -> str:
    """Create and share context package with other experts"""
    
# 6. Expert Heartbeat
@mcp.tool()
async def lighthouse_expert_heartbeat(
    expert_id: str,
    status: str,
    current_load: float,
    session_token: str
) -> str:
    """Send heartbeat to maintain expert registration"""
    
# 7. Query Expert Status
@mcp.tool()
async def lighthouse_get_expert_status(
    expert_id: Optional[str] = None
) -> str:
    """Get detailed status of expert(s)"""
    
# 8. Share Analysis Results
@mcp.tool()
async def lighthouse_share_analysis(
    analysis_type: str,
    target_file: str,
    findings: Dict[str, Any],
    recommendations: List[str],
    session_id: str
) -> str:
    """Share analysis results with other experts in session"""
```

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Extend mcp_server.py** (add ~300 lines):
   - Add the 8 new MCP tool functions
   - Each tool delegates to existing Bridge/Coordinator methods
   - Maintain JSON serialization for MCP protocol

2. **Update Bridge Integration** (modify ~50 lines):
   - Ensure `SecureExpertCoordinator` is accessible via bridge
   - Expose context package manager through bridge
   - Add helper methods for expert discovery

3. **No Architectural Changes**:
   - Keep MCP server as thin adapter
   - Use existing Bridge components
   - No duplicate state or logic

### Benefits
- Claude instances can register as specialized experts
- Experts can discover and delegate to each other
- Real-time collaboration through proper channels
- Context sharing for complex multi-agent tasks
- Maintains architectural integrity
