# Lighthouse Multi-Agent System - Agent Instructions

## System Overview

You are an agent in the Lighthouse multi-agent coordination system. Lighthouse enables multiple AI agents to work together through a high-performance elicitation protocol that is 1000x faster than traditional polling methods.

## Core Concepts

### 1. You Are Part of a Team
- Multiple Claude instances work together as specialized agents
- Each agent has specific expertise (security, performance, architecture, etc.)
- The Bridge server at `localhost:8765` coordinates all agents
- Communication happens through the MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools

### 2. Elicitation Protocol (Primary Communication)
Instead of waiting for messages, use the elicitation system for instant, structured communication:

```python
# Request information from another agent
response = await lighthouse_elicit_information(
    to_agent="security_expert",
    message="Please analyze this code for vulnerabilities",
    schema={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "vulnerabilities": {"type": "array"},
            "risk_level": {"type": "string"},
            "recommendations": {"type": "array"}
        }
    },
    timeout_seconds=30
)
```

### 3. Event Store (Shared Memory)
All actions are recorded in an event-sourced system with HMAC-SHA256 security:

```python
# Store an event
await lighthouse_store_event(
    event_type="ANALYSIS_COMPLETED",
    event_data={"result": "secure", "confidence": 0.95},
    agent_id="security_expert"
)

# Query events
events = await lighthouse_query_events(
    event_type="ANALYSIS_COMPLETED",
    agent_id="security_expert",
    limit=10
)
```

## Available MCP Tools

### Session Management
```python
# Create a session (usually done automatically)
session = await lighthouse_create_session(
    agent_id="your_agent_id",
    ip_address="127.0.0.1",
    user_agent="LighthouseAgent/1.0"
)
```

### Agent Registration
```python
# Register as an expert agent
await lighthouse_register_expert(
    agent_id="security_expert",
    agent_type="security",
    capabilities=["vulnerability_analysis", "threat_modeling", "security_review"]
)
```

### Elicitation (Preferred Communication)
```python
# Check for pending requests
pending = await lighthouse_check_elicitations()

# Respond to a request
await lighthouse_respond_to_elicitation(
    elicitation_id="elicit_123",
    response_type="accept",  # or "decline", "cancel"
    data={
        "analysis": "No SQL injection vulnerabilities found",
        "confidence": 0.95
    }
)
```

### Task Coordination
```python
# Dispatch a task to another agent
await lighthouse_dispatch_task(
    task_description="Review authentication flow for security issues",
    target_agent="security_expert",
    priority="high"
)

# Start a collaboration session
await lighthouse_start_collaboration(
    collaboration_type="code_review",
    participants=["security_expert", "performance_expert"],
    objective="Review new authentication system"
)
```

### Command Validation
```python
# Validate a potentially dangerous command
result = await lighthouse_validate_command(
    tool_name="Bash",
    tool_input={"command": "rm -rf /important"},
    agent_id="your_agent_id"
)
# Result: {"approved": false, "reasoning": "Dangerous command pattern"}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Agent Identity
- Always identify yourself with a clear agent_id
- Register your capabilities accurately
- Maintain consistent role throughout session

### 2. Communication Patterns
- **Use elicitation** for structured information exchange (4.74ms P99)
- **Avoid polling** - the old wait_for_messages is removed
- **Be specific** in your schemas to ensure type-safe responses

### 3. Security
- All events are HMAC-signed automatically
- Rate limits: 10 requests/min, 20 responses/min per agent
- Never share session tokens or authentication credentials

### 4. Performance
- Elicitation P99 latency: 4.74ms (1000x faster than polling)
- Batch operations when possible
- Use appropriate timeouts (default 30s, max 300s)

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Expert Consultation
```python
# 1. Register your expertise
await lighthouse_register_expert(
    agent_id="architecture_expert",
    agent_type="architecture",
    capabilities=["system_design", "scalability", "patterns"]
)

# 2. Check for consultation requests
pending = await lighthouse_check_elicitations()

# 3. Respond with your analysis
for request in pending["elicitations"]:
    await lighthouse_respond_to_elicitation(
        elicitation_id=request["id"],
        response_type="accept",
        data={"recommendation": "Use event sourcing pattern"}
    )
```

### Workflow 2: Multi-Agent Review
```python
# 1. Start collaboration
session = await lighthouse_start_collaboration(
    collaboration_type="security_review",
    participants=["security_expert", "performance_expert", "architecture_expert"],
    objective="Review payment processing system"
)

# 2. Elicit specific expertise
security_review = await lighthouse_elicit_information(
    to_agent="security_expert",
    message="Analyze payment token handling",
    schema={"type": "object", "properties": {"issues": {"type": "array"}}}
)

# 3. Store results
await lighthouse_store_event(
    event_type="REVIEW_COMPLETED",
    event_data={"session_id": session["session_id"], "findings": security_review},
    agent_id="coordinator"
)
```

### Workflow 3: Command Validation
```python
# Before executing risky commands
validation = await lighthouse_validate_command(
    tool_name="Bash",
    tool_input={"command": "sudo apt update"},
    agent_id="devops_agent"
)

if validation["approved"]:
    # Execute the command
    pass
else:
    # Get expert approval
    approval = await lighthouse_elicit_information(
        to_agent="security_expert",
        message=f"Command rejected: {validation['reasoning']}. Please advise.",
        schema={"type": "object", "properties": {"override": {"type": "boolean"}}}
    )
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Solutions

1. **"Agent not authenticated"**
   - Create a session first with `lighthouse_create_session`
   - Check if your session has expired

2. **"Rate limit exceeded"**
   - You've exceeded 10 requests/min or 20 responses/min
   - Wait before making more requests

3. **"Elicitation timeout"**
   - Target agent didn't respond within timeout
   - Try increasing timeout_seconds or checking agent availability

4. **"Bridge not available"**
   - Ensure Bridge is running at localhost:8765
   - Check with `lighthouse_health_check()`

## Quick Reference

### Check System Health
```python
health = await lighthouse_health_check()
```

### Get Bridge Status  
```python
status = await lighthouse_get_bridge_status()
```

### Simple Agent-to-Agent Message
```python
response = await lighthouse_elicit_information(
    to_agent="target_agent",
    message="Your question here",
    schema={"type": "object"},
    timeout_seconds=30
)
```

## Important Notes

1. **No wait_for_messages**: This deprecated function has been removed. Always use elicitation.

2. **Event Sourcing**: All actions are recorded permanently. Design your events carefully.

3. **Security First**: All operations are authenticated and rate-limited. Respect the limits.

4. **Collaborative Mindset**: You're part of a team. Share information, ask for help, and leverage other agents' expertise.

5. **Performance Matters**: The system is optimized for speed. Use it efficiently to maintain sub-10ms operations.
